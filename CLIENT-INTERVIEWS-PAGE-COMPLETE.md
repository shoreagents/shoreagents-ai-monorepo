# ✅ CLIENT INTERVIEWS PAGE - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Branch:** `Gunting-Project-Scissor`  
**Commit:** `c153efb`

## 🎯 PROBLEM SOLVED

**Issue:** After submitting an interview request, the client was redirected to `/client/interviews` which returned a **404 error**.

**Root Cause:** The page didn't exist! Only the submission API was created, but no viewing page.

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS BUILT

### 1️⃣ **GET API Endpoint**
**File:** `app/api/client/interviews/route.ts` (50 lines)

**Functionality:**
- Authenticates client user
- Fetches all interview requests for that client
- Orders by creation date (newest first)
- Returns full interview request data

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "interviews": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "candidateFirstName": "Candy",
      "bpocCandidateId": "uuid",
      "preferredTimes": ["Monday 10am", "Tuesday 2pm"],
      "clientNotes": "Looking forward to meeting",
      "status": "PENDING",
      "scheduledTime": null,
      "meetingLink": null,

      "createdAt": "2025-10-23T...",

    }
  ]
}
```

4. Employment contract auto-created
5. Staff redirected to `/contract` page
6. Review 5 sections, draw signature

8. Redirect to `/onboarding`

**Status:** 100% Complete, ready for testing!
