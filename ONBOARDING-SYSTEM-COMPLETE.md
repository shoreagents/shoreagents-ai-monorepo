# üéâ STAFF ONBOARDING SYSTEM - FULLY WORKING! üéâ

## **TESTED END-TO-END AND WORKING PERFECTLY**

Date: October 14, 2025  
Branch: `full-stack-StepTen`  
Status: **PRODUCTION READY** ‚úÖ

---

## **WHAT WORKS:**

### ‚úÖ **1. STAFF SIGNUP & ONBOARDING**
- Staff can signup with email/password
- Auto-redirected to onboarding wizard
- **5-step wizard:**
  1. Personal Information (name, address, gender, civil status, DOB)
  2. Government IDs (SSS, TIN, Philhealth, Pagibig) + Valid ID photo
  3. Documents Upload (Birth Cert, NBI, Police, Gov ID docs)
  4. E-Signature Upload
  5. Emergency Contact

### ‚úÖ **2. FILE UPLOADS TO SUPABASE**
- **Simplified structure:** `staff/staff_onboarding/{userId}/filename.ext`
- All documents saved with proper URLs
- Signature saved as `signature.png`
- RLS policies working (staff can only access their own files)

### ‚úÖ **3. COMPLETION TRACKING**
- **Each section = 20%**
- Staff reaches **100%** when ALL sections submitted
- **100% does NOT mean verified** - just submitted
- Blue banner shows "‚è≥ Awaiting Admin Verification"
- Banner stays visible until admin completes verification

### ‚úÖ **4. ADMIN VERIFICATION PORTAL**
- Admin sees list with **"üìã Ready for Verification"** badge (BLUE)
- Can click "View Details" to review each section
- Can Approve/Reject individual sections with feedback
- **Emoji logs track every step** üé®
- After 5th approval: **Green "Complete Onboarding" form appears!** üíö

### ‚úÖ **5. ADMIN COMPLETE ONBOARDING**
Admin fills final employment details:
- **Company Assignment** (dropdown)
- **Employment Status** (Probation/Regular)
- **Start Date** (date picker)
- **Shift Time** (text, e.g. "9:00 AM - 6:00 PM")
- **Role Title** (text)
- **Monthly Salary (PHP)** (number)
- **HMO Coverage** (toggle)

### ‚úÖ **6. DATABASE AUTO-POPULATION**
When admin clicks "Complete Onboarding":

**`staff_users` updated:**
- `companyId` assigned
- `name` updated with full legal name

**`staff_profiles` created:**
- `gender`, `civilStatus`, `dateOfBirth` from onboarding
- `salary`, `currentRole`, `employmentStatus` from admin form
- `daysEmployed` auto-calculated from start date
- `totalLeave` = 0 for Probation, 12 for Regular
- `hmo` from admin form

**`staff_personal_records` created:**
- SSS, TIN, Philhealth, Pagibig numbers
- Emergency contact (name, number, relationship)
- Document URLs (valid ID, birth cert, NBI, police clearance)

**`work_schedules` created:**
- 7 days with 5 workdays
- `startTime` and `endTime` parsed from shift time

**`staff_onboarding` updated:**
- `isComplete` set to `true`

### ‚úÖ **7. STAFF STATUS PAGE**
- New page: `/onboarding/status`
- Shows detailed status for all 5 sections
- Displays admin feedback if rejected
- Shows verification timestamps
- Links to view submitted documents

---

## **THE BUG FIX:**

### **Problem:**
Staff onboarding was showing "‚úÖ Verified & Complete" immediately after staff finished (100%), even though admin hadn't verified anything yet.

### **Root Cause:**
**5 API routes** were automatically setting `isComplete = true` when staff reached 100%:
- `/api/onboarding/personal-info`
- `/api/onboarding/gov-ids`
- `/api/onboarding/documents/submit`
- `/api/onboarding/signature`
- `/api/onboarding/emergency-contact`

### **Solution:**
- Removed `isComplete` auto-set from ALL 5 routes
- Now `isComplete` is **ONLY** set by `/api/admin/staff/onboarding/[staffUserId]/complete`
- This ensures staff show as "üìã Ready for Verification" (not "Verified & Complete") until admin explicitly completes

### **Commit:**
```
fix: CRITICAL - Remove isComplete auto-set from all onboarding submission routes
```

## **KNOWN ISSUE (FOR LATER):**

**Freddy's Dashboard Empty:**
- After onboarding completion, staff dashboard shows no data
- Likely because demo data (tasks, posts, tickets) is hardcoded or not linked to new user
- **NOT URGENT** - onboarding flow is complete
- Will fix separately when building out staff dashboard features

---

## **WHAT'S NEXT:**

### **Immediate (for James):**
1. UI/UX polish (already in Linear task SHO-30)
2. Better styling for onboarding wizard
3. Add loading states
4. Improve error messages

### **Later:**
1. Fix staff dashboard data display
2. Add email notifications (staff when approved/rejected, admin when new submission)
3. Add ability to re-upload rejected documents without restarting
4. Add PDF preview for documents
5. Add admin analytics (how many pending, average approval time, etc.)

---

## **PRODUCTION READY:**
