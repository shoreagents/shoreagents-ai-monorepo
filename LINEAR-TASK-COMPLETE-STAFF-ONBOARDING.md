  - Birth Certificate
  - NBI Clearance
  - Police Clearance
  - ID Photo (for profile)
- Real-time upload progress indicators
- Shows "Already uploaded ‚úì" with View links when returning

**Step 5: Emergency Contact** ‚úÖ
- Emergency contact name, phone, relationship
- Final step that triggers 100% completion
- Clear success message when all done

#### 4. **API Routes** (100% Complete)

**Personal Info:** `app/api/onboarding/personal-info/route.ts` ‚úÖ
- POST endpoint saves personal data
- Sets status to SUBMITTED
- Updates completion percentage

**Government IDs:** `app/api/onboarding/gov-ids/route.ts` ‚úÖ
- POST endpoint saves SSS, TIN, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG
- Sets status to SUBMITTED
- Updates completion percentage

**Document Upload:** `app/api/onboarding/documents/upload/route.ts` ‚úÖ
- POST endpoint handles file uploads to Supabase
- Validates file type and size
- Saves to `staff_onboarding/{userId}/{filename}.ext`
- Returns public URL
- Updates database with document URL

**Signature Upload:** `app/api/onboarding/signature/route.ts` ‚úÖ
- POST endpoint handles signature upload
- Saves to `staff_onboarding/{userId}/signature.ext`
- Sets signatureStatus to SUBMITTED
- **NEW 100% LOGIC:** Counts SUBMITTED as complete

**Emergency Contact:** `app/api/onboarding/emergency-contact/route.ts` ‚úÖ
- POST endpoint saves emergency contact
- Sets emergencyContactStatus to SUBMITTED
- **NEW 100% LOGIC:** Counts SUBMITTED as complete

#### 5. **Admin Verification Portal** (95% Complete)

**Admin List View:** `app/admin/staff/onboarding/page.tsx` ‚úÖ
- Shows all staff with onboarding records
- Displays completion percentage
- Shows overall status (Pending/Submitted/Approved)
- Click to view individual staff details

**Admin Detail View:** `app/admin/staff/onboarding/[staffUserId]/page.tsx` ‚úÖ

- POST endpoint to approve/reject sections
- Updates section status (APPROVED/REJECTED)
- Saves admin feedback
- Records verification timestamp and admin ID

#### 6. **Progress Calculation Logic** (100% Complete - NEW!)

**OLD LOGIC (75% bug):**
- Only counted APPROVED sections as complete
- Staff stuck at 75% waiting for admin

**NEW LOGIC (100% working!):**
```typescript
// Each section = 20% when SUBMITTED or APPROVED
// 100% = Staff completed all 5 sections
let totalProgress = 0
sections.forEach(status => {
  if (status === "SUBMITTED" || status === "APPROVED") {
    totalProgress += 20
  }
})
```

**Result:**
- Step 1 done = 20%
- Step 2 done = 40%
- Step 3 done = 60%
- Step 4 done = 80%
- Step 5 done = **100%** ‚úÖ

**Admin verification is SEPARATE** - approves/rejects but doesn't affect completion %.

#### 7. **Document Persistence** (100% Complete)
- Upload document ‚Üí leave page ‚Üí come back
- Shows "Already uploaded ‚úì" in green box
- "View" link to open document in new tab
- Can replace document with new file input
- All state preserved across sessions

#### 8. **Bug Fixes Applied** (100% Complete)
- ‚úÖ Fixed "Welcome back, Maria!" ‚Üí Now shows actual user's first name
- ‚úÖ Fixed stuck "Saving..." button ‚Üí 30-second timeout + better error handling
- ‚úÖ Fixed 75% completion bug ‚Üí New logic counts SUBMITTED as complete
- ‚úÖ Added detailed console logging for debugging (press F12)
- ‚úÖ Fixed document persistence UI

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT'S MISSING / NOT IMPLEMENTED

### üìÑ Document Types (Minor)
**From Plan:** 14 document types  
**Implemented:** 5 core document types + signature

**Missing Documents (not critical):**
- ‚ùå Certificate of Employment
- ‚ùå SSS Document
- ‚ùå TIN Document  
- ‚ùå PhilHealth Document
- ‚ùå Pag-IBIG Document
- ‚ùå BIR Form 2316

**Status:** Low priority - the 5 core documents are sufficient for MVP. Additional document types can be added later by copying the existing pattern.

### üîí Supabase RLS Policies (Critical - Manual Setup Required)
**Status:** SQL scripts provided in `SUPABASE-SETUP-EXACT-STEPS.md`

**What needs to be done manually:**
1. Create `staff` bucket in Supabase dashboard
2. Set bucket to private
3. Run SQL to create RLS policies:
   - Staff can upload to their own folder
   - Staff can read their own files
   - Admins can read all files

**Time required:** 5 minutes (copy-paste SQL)

### üìß Email Notifications (Not Implemented)
**From Plan:** 
- Email when admin approves/rejects
- Email when onboarding complete

**Status:** Not implemented - can be added later with Resend/SendGrid

### üß™ Admin Testing (Pending Manual Test)
**What's built but not tested:**
- Admin approval flow ‚Üí Profile creation
- Admin rejection flow ‚Üí Staff re-upload
- "Complete Onboarding" button ‚Üí Profile + WorkSchedule creation

**Reason:** Need real admin credentials and staff at 100% to test

## üí° KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### 1. **Simplified Storage Structure**
**Decision:** `staff/staff_onboarding/{userId}/` (not separate folders per doc type)  
**Reason:** Easier to manage, cleaner URLs, simpler RLS policies  
**Benefit:** Can see all staff docs in one folder

### 2. **100% = Staff Complete (Not Admin Verified)**
**Decision:** Count SUBMITTED status as complete (not just APPROVED)  
**Reason:** Better UX - staff knows when THEY'RE done  
**Benefit:** Clear separation between staff completion vs admin verification

### 3. **Single Upload Endpoint for All Documents**
**Decision:** One `/api/onboarding/documents/upload` route with `documentType` param  
**Reason:** DRY principle, easier to maintain  
**Benefit:** Add new doc types by updating config object only

### 4. **Document Persistence in UI**
**Decision:** Show "Already uploaded ‚úì" with View links on page return  
**Reason:** Users expect to see what they've uploaded  
**Benefit:** Clear feedback, can verify uploads

### 5. **30-Second Timeout on Final Step**
**Decision:** Prevent infinite "Saving..." if API fails  
**Reason:** Better error handling, doesn't trap user  
**Benefit:** Can retry or contact support
