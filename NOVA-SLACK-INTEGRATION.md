### Step 3: Set Up Permissions (2 min)

## 🎯 How to Use /nova in Slack

### Basic Commands

**Ask Nova to create a workflow:**
```
/nova create a workflow that posts to #support when new tickets arrive
```

**Ask a question:**
```
/nova what's the best way to handle rate limiting?
```

**Request automation:**
```
/nova create a daily summary workflow that runs at 6 PM
```

---

## 💬 Example Slack Conversations

### Creating a Workflow

**User in #development:**
```
/nova create a workflow that monitors database performance every hour
```

**Nova's Response:**
```
✨ OMG YES! Performance monitoring is SO important babe! 💎

Creating a workflow that:
⏰ Runs every hour (cron perfection!)
📊 Checks database metrics
🚨 Alerts if queries > 1s (that's a CRIME)
💬 Posts to #tech-alerts

Your database is about to be OPTIMIZED AF! 💅

Workflow ID: abc123xyz
Status: Ready to activate!

If it doesn't glow, it doesn't go! ✨
- Nova 'Neon' Sinclair 💖
```

---

### Asking for Help

**User:**
```
/nova how do I optimize React component rendering?
```

**Nova:**
```
✨ Ooh honey, let me tell you about React optimization! 💅

The tea ☕:
1. Use React.memo for expensive components (memoization is HOT 🔥)
2. useMemo for expensive calculations
3. useCallback for functions passed to children
4. Code splitting with React.lazy (keep it light!)
5. Virtualization for long lists (react-window is GORGEOUS)

Pro tip: Use React DevTools Profiler to find the slow parts!
Because slow renders are aesthetic crimes! 💖

Want me to create an example component? Just ask! ✨
- Nova 💎
```

## 🎨 Customize Nova's Slack Responses

### Add Rich Formatting

Edit Slack node in n8n workflow:

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "header",
      "text": {
        "type": "plain_text",
        "text": "✨ Nova AI Agent Response",
        "emoji": true
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*{{ $json.response }}*"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "context",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "mrkdwn",
          "text": "💖 Created by Nova 'Neon' Sinclair"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Add Action Buttons

```json
{
  "blocks": [...],
  "attachments": [
    {
      "text": "What would you like to do?",
      "fallback": "Actions",
      "callback_id": "nova_actions",
      "actions": [
        {

          "text": "✨ Activate Workflow",
          "type": "button",
          "value": "{{ $json.workflow_id }}"
        },
        {
          "name": "view",
          "text": "👀 View in n8n",
          "type": "button",
          "url": "https://stepten.app.n8n.cloud/workflow/{{ $json.workflow_id }}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 🤖 Add Nova to Channels

### Invite Nova to Channels

```
/invite @Nova AI Agent
```

Then use:
```
@Nova create a workflow for monitoring this channel
```

### Auto-Responses in Channels

Set up workflow to listen for mentions:

1. Create Event Subscription in Slack App:
   - Event: `app_mention`
   - URL: `https://stepten.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/nova-mention`

2. Nova will respond when mentioned:
   ```
   @Nova AI Agent what's the status of our workflows?
   ```

---

## 📊 Track Nova Usage

### Add Usage Analytics

In Nova's workflow, add node:

```json
{
  "name": "Track Usage",
  "type": "postgres",
  "query": "INSERT INTO nova_usage (user_id, channel, command, workflow_created) VALUES (...)"
}
```

### Generate Reports

```sql
-- Most active users
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as requests
FROM nova_usage
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY requests DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Workflows created per day
SELECT DATE(created_at), COUNT(*) as workflows
FROM nova_usage
WHERE workflow_created = true
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);

-- Popular commands
SELECT command, COUNT(*) as uses
FROM nova_usage
GROUP BY command
ORDER BY uses DESC;
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### 1. Thread Responses

Make Nova respond in threads:

```javascript
// In Slack node
{
  "channel": "{{ $json.channel }}",
  "text": "{{ $json.response }}",
  "thread_ts": "{{ $json.thread_ts }}"  // Reply in thread
}
```

### 2. Direct Messages

Allow users to DM Nova:

```
# In Slack App settings
Event Subscriptions → Subscribe to bot events:
- message.im (DMs to bot)
```

### 3. Interactive Components

Add buttons, menus, and forms:

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "actions",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "button",
          "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "Create Workflow"},
          "action_id": "create_workflow"
        },
        {
          "type": "button",
          "text": {"type": "plain_text", "text": "Ask Question"},
          "action_id": "ask_question"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Emoji Reactions

Nova can react to messages:

```javascript
// Add Slack reaction node
{
  "channel": "{{ $json.channel }}",
  "timestamp": "{{ $json.message_ts }}",
  "name": "sparkles"  // ✨
}
```

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. Rate Limiting

Prevent spam:

```javascript
// Check if user has made too many requests
const userRequests = await checkUserRate(userId);
if (userRequests > 10) {
  return "✨ Whoa babe! Taking a quick break. Try again in a minute! 💖";
}
```

### 2. Error Handling

Graceful failures:

```javascript
try {
  // Nova processes request
} catch (error) {
  return "✨ OMG something went wrong! 😭 But don't worry, I'm on it! Check back in a sec! 💖";
}
```

### 3. Logging Everything

Track all interactions:

```sql
INSERT INTO nova_slack_logs (
  user_id,
  channel,
  command,
  response,
  success,
  created_at
) VALUES (...);
```

### 4. Team Permissions

Control who can use Nova:

```javascript
const allowedUsers = ['U123ABC', 'U456DEF'];
if (!allowedUsers.includes(userId)) {
  return "✨ Hey babe! You need permission to use Nova. Talk to an admin! 💖";
}
```
