Now it's back at it, but after trying to wait for it to publish, it will give me an error ""unable to publish"" instead. What's annoying is that after refreshing the page, Meta business suite is getting a glitch that I have to recreate the post or start everything from scratch and retry to publish which only gets back to the error. We already have 2 pending insta posts that's still won't upload and I even had hard times trying to create a report this morning as I cannot access the ""View Insights"" button of the Facebook studio(pls see attached)

If I browse/open through FB or insta and other online tools though I can still do it but loads very slow.

"Task","865brz7y2","SAS-295","Noel Carlos | 20 February 2023 | INTERNET IS VEEEEERY SLOW","Closed","Hi, I believe it's not just me, and I never wanted to take this against our management. But as we all know, our office internet has been very incompetent since last year. If we file a ticket, an IT comes in only to provide a temporary fix which results to the internet going back to its same issue almost everyday. Today I had to compromise heaps of emails from my client's agents because I had to download a 7mb file for over 45 mins. My work phase has been very slow lately although considering that my work load is higher that a usual sales admin person does, it becomes more stressful to handle it all because of a 2005 kind of internet speed. I don't think there's still hope for this to be fixed because I don't see the problem elsewhere rather than in our ISP itself. As you can see, instead of ""computer/equipment"" tag, I have tagged this as Check-in because I have been very frustrated and stressed out lately with my job due to the unusual work volume considering I'm handling 2 roles at the same time since August and I am already being overwhelmed with tasks, then the internet issues would add up as well. There were times that it's chill but when I get smashed by the tasks I can only work at a speed of a mountaintop so the stress as well as the pressure of not being able to do everything on time mixes up. I understand Brett has promised me a promotion so I can have someone over here to help out but won't happen as of yet due to a tough market which I also understand. However, with all the stress that these issues are causing me, and considering I can just simply click my mouse and find another job with a compensation that's really aligned to my capabilities and experiences as a Sales admin and Digital marketing combined while I'm working at the comfort of our home, I don't think these issues will make me stay any longer. Again I am not and will never take these against you guys, I appreciate all the efforts that you are doing so we are all happy and considering I've even became the EOTM for the second time now. I have never been recognized like that before but, I'm afraid I might consider leaving soon as I can't afford to be so stressed out and not get enough sleep at night.","[]","none","Resolved | CPU has been replaced, and other concerns have been attended by  @Kath Macenas    ",5,0,"","","Monday, February 20th 2023, 9:15:48 am +08:00","Wednesday, February 22nd 2023, 7:37:55 am +08:00","Monday, August 18th 2025, 12:08:17 pm +08:00","Tuesday, February 21st 2023, 8:28:28 am +08:00","ClickBot","Squad Support","hidden","Squad Tickets","[]","[]","","[Squad Tickets]","[]","","","","",,0,"[]","[2a86j11]","https://t3826572.p.clickup-attachments.com/t3826572/50771038-95b9-4301-91c7-7c6e93651ce7/20230222_073413.jpg","noel.carlos1221@gmail.com","Noel","","Check-in (Chat with Account Manager)","as above","SAS-295"

Our email in drafts is shuffling; we draft using our payroll account email, and then it will suddenly be saved in our personal account. Normally, when we open our Outlook, it automatically categorizes emails. (Ex: 'Ana To Do'), but now, I have to manually set it up to categorize them accordingly. Then as of today, 08/05, my outlook here in the office has been affected too. Same issue. Drafts are shuffling, and another concern was the delay in receiving emails. I sent some emails at around 6:39am, and then I received replies at around 8:40am, which was 2 hours delayed. We hope you can help us sort this out, as we have timeframes for processing payrolls for our partners/clients.

I am currently experiencing a connection issue with one particular website used for Urban X. I cannot seem to access the Xero website. I am using PLDT Fibre as the wifi at home. I can access other websites just fine, I only have a problem with Xero. It seems to have a problem with PLDT not allowing access to Xero or vice versa because I cannot access it with my phone as well using PLDT wifi.

I have tried clearing browser history and cache to both Microsoft Edge and Chrome, still no luck. Hopefully you can help me with this issue. 

Thank you so much.
