## 🎯 MARIA SANTOS LOGIN

**Email:** `maria.santos@techcorp.com` OR `maria@shoreagents.com`  
**Password:** `password123`  
**Role:** STAFF

Check Prisma Studio (running on port 5555) to verify she exists.

---

## 🚨 REAL PROBLEMS (Not documentation fluff)

### 1. Which Login Works for Maria?
The docs show TWO different emails:
- `maria.santos@techcorp.com` (from REAL-TEST-LOGINS.md)
- `maria@shoreagents.com` (from other docs)

**Need to check database** to see which one is real.

### 2. Client Portal Authentication
The docs are right about this one:
- ❌ Client layout has no auth check
- ❌ Anyone can access `/client/*` routes
- ❌ No role verification

**Location:** `/app/client/layout.tsx`

### 3. ClientUser vs User Confusion
- Should clients log in as:
  - A) User with role="CLIENT"?
  - B) ClientUser with separate auth?
- Currently unclear which model to use

### 4. Admin Portal
- All pages exist ✅
- All API routes exist ✅
- But docs say "22% complete"? Bullshit or are APIs not connected to pages?

---

## ✅ WHAT DEFINITELY WORKS (Per Docs)

1. **Client Tasks System** - Documented as "100% BULLETPROOF"
   - Bulk create
   - Kanban board
   - Two-way sync with staff
   - Source badges (CLIENT vs SELF)

2. **Client Monitoring** - Documented as "100% COMPLETE"
   - Real-time performance tracking
   - Productivity scoring
   - Staff metrics

3. **Document Sharing** - Documented as "100% COMPLETE"
   - Two-way sync
   - Staff uploads → Client sees (purple badge)
   - Client uploads → Staff sees (blue badge)

4. **Time Tracking** - Working
   - Clock in/out
   - Client can view staff hours

5. **Critical Patterns Document** - Lists all patterns that MUST NOT be broken
   - Import patterns (auth, prisma)
   - Profile field names (currentRole, client - NOT position, department)
   - Task source tracking
   - Document sync

## 🔍 WHAT TO TEST

### Test 1: Can Maria Login?
```bash
# Try both emails at http://localhost:3000/login/staff
maria.santos@techcorp.com / password123
maria@shoreagents.com / password123
```

### Test 2: Does Staff Portal Work?
- Login as Maria
- Check dashboard loads
- Check tasks page
- Check time tracking

### Test 3: Does Client Portal Work?
- Go to http://localhost:3000/client
- Does it load? (It shouldn't ask for auth per docs)
- Does it show Maria's data?

### Test 4: Does Admin Portal Work?
- Need admin login
- Email: `sysadmin@shoreagents.com`
- Password: `admin123`

---

## 💡 NEXT STEPS

1. **Start the dev server** and test Maria's login
2. **Check Prisma Studio** (already running on :5555) to see actual data
3. **Test each portal** to see what actually works vs claims
4. **Fix Client Portal auth** if it's really missing
5. **Verify Admin Portal** pages are connected to APIs

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION BULLSHIT DETECTED

The docs claim:
- ❌ "22% complete" - But ALL pages and 55 APIs exist
- ❌ "12 API routes" - Actually 55 routes
- ❌ "Backend completion v1.0.0" - Then why claim incomplete?

**Reality:** Way more is built than docs admit, but may have integration issues or bugs.
