# üéØ Integrated Shift Management System - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING

---

## üìã What Was Built

Transformed the time tracking and breaks systems into a unified **Integrated Shift Management System** that tracks:
- Late arrivals for shifts
- Scheduled break times (locked in for the day)
- Break lateness tracking
- Clock-out reasons
- Net work hours (total time minus breaks)

---

## üîß Technical Changes

### 1. Schema Updates

#### Break Model
- ‚úÖ Added `timeEntryId` to link breaks to shift sessions
- ‚úÖ Added `isLate` boolean to track late returns
- ‚úÖ Added `lateBy` integer for minutes late
- ‚úÖ Added relation to `TimeEntry`

#### TimeEntry Model
- ‚úÖ Added `expectedClockIn` datetime from WorkSchedule
- ‚úÖ Added `wasLate` boolean
- ‚úÖ Added `lateBy` integer for minutes late
- ‚úÖ Added `clockOutReason` enum
- ‚úÖ Added `breaksScheduled` boolean
- ‚úÖ Added `breaks` relation

#### New Enum
- ‚úÖ Added `ClockOutReason` enum:
  - END_OF_SHIFT
  - EMERGENCY
  - SICK
  - EARLY_LEAVE_APPROVED
  - INTERNET_ISSUE
  - POWER_OUTAGE
  - PERSONAL
  - OTHER

### 2. API Routes Fixed/Created

#### Fixed
- ‚úÖ `/api/breaks` (GET & POST) - Fixed `userId` ‚Üí `staffUserId` bug

#### Updated
- ‚úÖ `/api/time-tracking/clock-in` - Now checks WorkSchedule and tracks lateness
- ‚úÖ `/api/time-tracking/clock-out` - Requires reason, calculates net work hours
- ‚úÖ `/api/breaks/end` - Tracks break lateness

#### New
- ‚úÖ `/api/time-tracking/schedule-breaks` - Lock in break schedule for the day
- ‚úÖ `/api/breaks/start` - Start a scheduled or unscheduled break

### 3. UI Components Created

#### ShiftModal (`components/shift-modal.tsx`)
Full-screen modal system for:
- Late clock-in alerts (cannot dismiss)
- Break reminders (can dismiss)
- Clock-out confirmation with reason selector

#### BreakScheduler (`components/break-scheduler.tsx`)
Modal for scheduling breaks at start of shift:
- Morning Break (15 min)
- Lunch Break (60 min)
- Afternoon Break (15 min)
- Can customize times or skip to use defaults

---

## üéØ How It Works

### Clock-In Flow
1. Staff clicks "Clock In"
2. System checks WorkSchedule for expected start time
3. If late, records `wasLate` and `lateBy` minutes
4. Shows BreakScheduler modal (if not already scheduled)
5. Staff can schedule breaks or skip

### Break Flow
1. Staff clicks "Start Break"
2. Records `actualStart` time
3. When staff returns, clicks "End Break"
4. System compares `actualEnd` to `scheduledEnd`
5. If late, records `isLate` and `lateBy` minutes

### Clock-Out Flow
1. Staff clicks "Clock Out"
2. System checks for active breaks (must end first)
3. Shows ShiftModal with reason selector (REQUIRED)
4. Calculates:
   - Total shift time
   - Total break time
   - **Net work hours** = Total - Breaks
5. Stores reason and net hours

---

## üìä Data Tracked Per Shift

### TimeEntry Record
```typescript
{
  clockIn: DateTime
  clockOut: DateTime
  expectedClockIn: DateTime?    // From WorkSchedule
  wasLate: boolean              // Late for shift?
  lateBy: Int?                  // Minutes late
  clockOutReason: ClockOutReason // Why they left
  breaksScheduled: boolean      // Did they schedule?
  totalHours: Decimal           // NET work hours (minus breaks)
}
```

### Break Records (linked to TimeEntry)
```typescript
{
  type: BreakType              // MORNING, LUNCH, AFTERNOON, AWAY
  scheduledStart: String?      // "10:00 AM"
  scheduledEnd: String?        // "10:15 AM"
  actualStart: DateTime?       // When they actually started
  actualEnd: DateTime?         // When they actually returned
  duration: Int?               // Actual minutes taken
  isLate: boolean              // Returned late?
  lateBy: Int?                 // Minutes late returning
  timeEntryId: String          // Links to shift
}
```

## üöÄ Admin/Client Benefits

### Reports Can Now Show:
1. **Shift Compliance**
   - How many staff were late
   - Average lateness per shift
   - Late clock-in patterns

2. **Break Compliance**
   - Did staff take scheduled breaks?
   - How long were breaks actually?
   - Who returns late from breaks?

3. **Clock-Out Reasons**
   - Why staff left early
   - Emergency patterns
   - Internet/power issues frequency

4. **Accurate Work Hours**
   - Net work hours (excludes breaks)
   - Break time per day
   - True productivity time

## üîç Still TODO

### UI Integration (Next Step)
- [ ] Update `/time-tracking` page to use new components
- [ ] Show shift status (on time / late)
- [ ] Display scheduled breaks for the day
- [ ] Add "Start Break" buttons for each break
- [ ] Integrate ShiftModal for clock-out

### Performance Tracking Integration
- [ ] Ensure break time doesn't count as "idle time"
- [ ] Exclude break periods from activity tracking
- [ ] Update productivity score calculation

### Electron Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Native notifications for break reminders
- [ ] Full-screen focus steal for late clock-in

### Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Shift session report view
- [ ] Lateness analytics
- [ ] Break compliance charts
- [ ] Clock-out reason breakdown

---

## üìù Testing Checklist

### Clock-In
- [ ] Clock in on time ‚Üí no late warning
- [ ] Clock in late ‚Üí shows late minutes
- [ ] Break scheduler appears on first clock-in
- [ ] Break scheduler does NOT appear if already scheduled

### Breaks
- [ ] Schedule breaks ‚Üí locks in times
- [ ] Cannot reschedule after locking
- [ ] Start break ‚Üí records actual start
- [ ] End break on time ‚Üí no late warning
- [ ] End break late ‚Üí records lateness

### Clock-Out
- [ ] Cannot clock out with active break
- [ ] Must select reason
- [ ] Shows net work hours (minus breaks)
- [ ] Records all data correctly

### Database
- [ ] TimeEntry has all new fields populated
- [ ] Breaks linked to TimeEntry via `timeEntryId`
- [ ] Late tracking works for both shift and breaks
- [ ] Clock-out reason stored correctly
