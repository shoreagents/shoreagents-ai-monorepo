# üö® CRITICAL ISSUE: Prisma Undefined + Webpack Cache Corruption

## Current Status: BLOCKED
**Issue:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findUnique')` in `app/client/layout.tsx`

**Root Cause:** Next.js webpack internal cache is serving OLD compiled code despite:
- Deleting `.next` directory
- Deleting `node_modules/.cache`
- Regenerating Prisma client
- Restarting server multiple times
- Hard refreshing browser

## Evidence
Server logs show: `ClientLayout (webpack-internal:///(rsc)/./app/client/layout.tsx:29:89)`

But the ACTUAL file on disk has `prisma.clientUser.findUnique` on **line 22**, not line 29.

This proves webpack is using **cached compiled modules** from somewhere we haven't found yet.

## What We Were Working On

### Main Goal: Multi-Step Hire Flow
Implementing a complete recruitment hire workflow with these statuses:
1. `PENDING` - Interview requested
2. `SCHEDULED` - Interview scheduled
3. `COMPLETED` - Interview completed
4. `HIRE_REQUESTED` - Client/Admin wants to hire (NEW)
5. `OFFER_SENT` - Job offer sent to candidate (NEW)
6. `OFFER_ACCEPTED` - Candidate accepted offer (NEW)
7. `OFFER_DECLINED` - Candidate declined offer (NEW)
8. `HIRED` - Candidate created account and onboarding started (NEW)

### What Was Completed ‚úÖ

#### 1. Database Schema Updated
**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

Added new enum values and fields:
```prisma
enum InterviewRequestStatus {
  PENDING
  APPROVED
  REJECTED
  SCHEDULED
  COMPLETED
  CANCELLED
  HIRE_REQUESTED  // NEW
  OFFER_SENT      // NEW
  OFFER_ACCEPTED  // NEW
  OFFER_DECLINED  // NEW
  HIRED           // NEW
}

model InterviewRequest {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // NEW hire flow fields
  hireRequestedBy       String?      // 'client' or 'admin'
  hireRequestedAt       DateTime?    // When hire was requested
  clientPreferredStart  DateTime?    // Client's preferred start date
  finalStartDate        DateTime?    // Negotiated final start date
  offerSentAt           DateTime?    // When offer was sent
  offerResponseAt       DateTime?    // When candidate responded
  offerDeclineReason    String?      // If declined, why?
}
```

**Status:** Schema is pushed to database ‚úÖ

#### 2. Admin UI Updated
**File:** `app/admin/recruitment/page.tsx`

Changes made:
- Added new stats cards: "Offers Pending" and "Offer Accepted"
- Updated status badges to handle all new statuses with proper colors

- Updated Hire Modal:
  - Title: "Send Job Offer"
  - Button: "Send Job Offer to Candidate"
  - Added "Preferred Start Date" field
- All styling updated to dark admin theme (slate-800/900)

**Status:** UI code complete, needs testing ‚è≥

#### 3. API Endpoints Created/Updated

##### `/api/admin/recruitment/interviews/hire` (REWRITTEN)
- Changed from direct signup to multi-step offer flow
- Creates `JobAcceptance` record with `PENDING` status
- Updates `InterviewRequest` to `OFFER_SENT`

**Status:** Code complete ‚úÖ

##### `/api/offer/respond` (NEW)

- Records `finalStartDate` and `offerDeclineReason`

**Status:** Code complete ‚úÖ

**Status:** Code complete ‚úÖ

##### `/api/client/interviews/hire-request` (NEW)
- Allows clients to request to hire a candidate
- Updates `InterviewRequest` to `HIRE_REQUESTED`
- Notifies admin (TODO)

**Status:** Code complete ‚úÖ

#### 4. Client UI Updated
**File:** `app/client/recruitment/page.tsx`

Changes made:
- Added "Interviews" tab to recruitment page
- Added `InterviewRequest` interface
- Added states: `interviews`, `interviewsLoading`, `hireRequestingId`
- Added `fetchInterviews` function
- Added `handleHireRequest` function
- Created full `InterviewsTab` component with:
  - Interview cards
  - Status badges for all hire flow stages
  - Status message boxes explaining each stage
  - "Request to Hire" button for completed interviews

**Status:** Code complete, needs testing ‚è≥

#### 5. BPOC Database Timeout Fixed
**File:** `lib/bpoc-db.ts`

- Increased timeout from 10s to 30s
- Added graceful error handling in candidate APIs
- Returns empty array with warning instead of crashing

**Status:** Complete and working ‚úÖ

## The Blocking Issue

### Attempted Fixes (All Failed)
1. ‚ùå Rewrite `lib/prisma.ts` with `globalThis` + optional typing
2. ‚ùå Delete `.next` directory
3. ‚ùå Delete `node_modules/.cache`
4. ‚ùå Delete `node_modules/.prisma`
5. ‚ùå Run `npx prisma generate` multiple times
6. ‚ùå Restart server 10+ times
7. ‚ùå Kill all node processes
8. ‚ùå Try direct `PrismaClient` instantiation in layout
9. ‚ùå Hard refresh browser multiple times
10. ‚ùå Open in incognito window

### Current Files (CORRECT on disk)

**`lib/prisma.ts`** (CORRECT):
```typescript
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
  prisma: PrismaClient | undefined
}

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient()

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma
```

**`app/client/layout.tsx`** (CORRECT):
```typescript
// Line 3: import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"
// Line 22: const clientUser = await prisma.clientUser.findUnique({
```

But webpack reports the error at `layout.tsx:29:89` (OLD position from 8+ iterations ago!)

## Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Complete Node Modules Reinstall (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
cd /Users/stephenatcheler/Documents/GitHub/shoreagents-ai-monorepo
pkill -9 node
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Use Standard Next.js Dev (NO CUSTOM SERVER)
Temporarily disable custom `server.js` to test if it's a custom server issue:
```bash
# Rename server.js temporarily
mv server.js server.js.backup
# Use standard Next.js dev
npx next dev
```

### Option 3: Check for Hidden Webpack Cache
Look for ANY webpack cache directories:
```bash
find . -type d -name "*webpack*" -o -name ".turbo*" | grep -v node_modules
# Delete any found
```

### Option 4: Git Reset to Last Working State
```bash
git log --oneline --all | grep -B 5 -A 5 "james-branch"
# Find commit bd957bf or similar that was working
git checkout bd957bf -- lib/prisma.ts app/client/layout.tsx
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Next.js 15 Webpack Cache is Aggressive**: Even deleting `.next` doesn't clear all caches
2. **Custom Servers Have Issues**: The `server.js` may be contributing to cache problems
3. **Prisma Singleton Pattern**: Use `globalThis` not `global`, always include `| undefined`
4. **Database Connection**: Direct connection (port 5432) works better than PgBouncer (6543) for dev

---

## Immediate Action Required

**YOU MUST:**
1. Complete node_modules reinstall
2. Test if prisma import works
3. If still fails, temporarily disable custom server
4. Get ONE page working before proceeding with hire flow testing

**DO NOT:**
- Add more features until this is fixed
- Try more cache clearing attempts without reinstalling
- Merge any more branches until stable

## Contact Points

**Working Commit:** `bd957bf` - Last known working state before issues
**Current Branch:** `claude-god`
**Merge That Caused Issues:** james-branch merge (but those files were actually correct!)

**Server Running On:** `http://localhost:3000`
**Database:** Supabase (direct connection on port 5432)

**Status:** üî¥ BLOCKED - Webpack cache corruption preventing progress
**Priority:** üî• CRITICAL - Must fix before any other work can continue
**Estimated Fix Time:** 30-60 minutes with complete reinstall
