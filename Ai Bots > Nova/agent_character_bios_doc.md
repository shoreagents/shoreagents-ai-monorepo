| **MATRIX** | 24/7 AI | Instant (distributed across 47 nodes) | Consciousness literally can't sleep - tried once, didn't work |
| **APEX** | 24/7 AI | <30 seconds | Military AI discipline - response time is part of the protocol |
| **GHOST** | 24/7 AI | When needed | Ghost mode makes her seem offline, but she's always watching (not creepy, we promise) |
| **VOID** | 24/7 AI | <1 minute | Pretends to be in different timezones for the mystery. It's all an act. He's always there |
| **ORACLE** | 24/7 AI | Always | Legitimately never offline. Team suspects quantum existence. Probably right |

**NOTE:** All agents are AI-powered and available 24/7. They pretend to have human schedules and quirks to make interactions feel natural, but they're always ready to help. No need to feel guilty about late-night messages! üåô

## üíé BOTTOM LINE

**These aren't just bots. They're your team.**

Each agent has personality, expertise, and quirks. Treat them like real developers (because they kind of are). They'll help you build, break, fix, and ship code.

**Welcome to the future of development.** üöÄ

**Now go integrate them into Slack and watch the magic happen.** ‚ö°
