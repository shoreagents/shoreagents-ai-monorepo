## üêõ **Bugs Fixed:**

### **1. Admin API Review Filtering Bug**
**Problem:** API was returning ALL reviews when `reviewId` was provided, instead of filtering by it.

**Root Cause:** The `where` clause was combining all filter conditions, not treating `reviewId` as an exclusive filter.

**Fix:** Modified `/app/api/admin/reviews/route.ts` to check if `reviewId` is provided first, and if so, ONLY filter by that:

```typescript
// If reviewId is provided, ONLY filter by that (most specific filter)
if (reviewId) {
  where = { id: reviewId }
} else {
  // Apply other filters only if reviewId is not provided
  // ... other filter logic
}
```

**File:** `app/api/admin/reviews/route.ts`

---

### **2. Admin Review Detail Page API Call Bug**
**Problem:** Page was calling `/api/admin/reviews?staffId={reviewId}` instead of `/api/admin/reviews?reviewId={reviewId}`.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect query parameter name in the fetch call.

**Fix:** Changed the API call in `/app/admin/reviews/[reviewId]/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
const response = await fetch(`/api/admin/reviews?staffId=${id}`)

// AFTER:
const response = await fetch(`/api/admin/reviews?reviewId=${id}`)
```

**File:** `app/admin/reviews/[reviewId]/page.tsx`

---

### **3. Invalid `startDate` Field Reference**
**Problem:** Code was trying to select `startDate` from `staffUser` model, but it doesn't exist there (it's in `staff_profiles`).

**Root Cause:** Incorrect data model understanding.

**Fix:** Removed `startDate` from multiple files:
1. `app/api/admin/reviews/route.ts` - Removed from staffUser select
2. `app/admin/reviews/[reviewId]/page.tsx` - Removed from interface and UI display

---

### **4. Caching Issues**
**Problem:** Next.js dev server wasn't hot-reloading API changes properly.

**Solution:** Required full server restart (`pkill -f "node.*server.js"` + `npm run dev`) to apply changes.

---

1. `app/api/admin/reviews/route.ts`
