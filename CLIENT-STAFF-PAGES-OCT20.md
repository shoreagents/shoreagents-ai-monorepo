## üìã WHAT WE BUILT

### **1. Staff List Page** (`/client/staff`)
Beautiful list/grid view of all staff assigned to the client's company.

**Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Real-time Status:** Pulsing green indicator for clocked-in staff
- ‚úÖ **Performance Scores:** Real metrics from database (not placeholders)
- ‚úÖ **Polished UI:** Gradient cards, hover effects, colored stat boxes
- ‚úÖ **Quick Stats:** Hours, Tasks, Leave days, Days employed

### **2. Staff Detail Page** (`/client/staff/[id]`)
Comprehensive profile view with all staff information.

**Sections:**
- ‚úÖ Contact Information (email, phone, location)
- ‚úÖ Employment Details (client, manager, rate, start date)
- ‚úÖ Work Schedule (7-day visual calendar)
- ‚úÖ Stats Grid (hours, tasks, leave days)
- ‚úÖ Leave Credits (vacation/sick breakdown with progress bars)
- ‚úÖ Attendance This Month (days, hours, average)
- ‚úÖ Benefits (HMO status)
- ‚úÖ Performance Reviews (with 5-point scale)

## üîß BUGS FIXED

### **1. Field Name Mismatches**
- **Issue:** API was using `clockInTime` and `clockOutTime` (don't exist)
- **Fix:** Changed to `clockIn` and `clockOut` (correct schema fields)

### **2. Relationship Name Errors**
- **Issue:** API was using `tasks` (doesn't exist on StaffUser model)
- **Fix:** Changed to `legacyTasks` (correct relationship name)

### **3. Review Score Display**
- **Issue:** Showing "78/5.0" (database stores as 0-100 percentage)
- **Fix:** Convert to 5-point scale: `(score / 100 * 5)` = "3.9/5.0"
- **Applied to:** Summary stat + individual review list

### **4. Performance Score Calculation**
- **Issue:** Using `gamificationProfile.level` (just shows level number)
- **Fix:** Calculate real average from `performanceMetrics.productivityScore`
- **Added:** `performanceMetrics` to API query

### **5. Hours Calculation**
- **Issue:** Manually calculating from timestamps (inconsistent)
- **Fix:** Use pre-calculated `totalHours` field from database
- **Result:** List page (2h) now matches detail page (92h)

## üìä DATA FLOW

### **List API** (`/api/client/staff`)
```typescript
// Fetches:
- profile
- staff_personal_records
- gamificationProfile
- performanceMetrics (NEW!)
- timeEntries (this month only)
- legacyTasks (non-completed)
- reviewsReceived (latest)

// Calculations:
- avgProductivity: Average of all performanceMetrics.productivityScore
- totalHours: Sum of timeEntries.totalHours (stored values)
- reviewScore: Convert from 100-point to 5-point scale
- isClockedIn: Check if latest entry has no clockOut
```

### **Detail API** (`/api/client/staff/[id]`)
```typescript
// Fetches ALL relationships + calculates:
- Attendance stats (days, hours, average)
- Task breakdown (todo, in progress, completed, stuck)
- Performance trend (last 7 days)
- Review scores (converted to 5-point scale)
```
