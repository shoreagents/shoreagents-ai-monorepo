## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Trigger Review Creation" returns 0 reviews

**Cause:** No staff users with appropriate `startDate`

**Fix:**
1. Check database for staff users
2. Verify `startDate` field has values
3. For testing, set startDate to 25 days ago:
   ```sql
   UPDATE staff_users 
   SET "startDate" = NOW() - INTERVAL '25 days'
   WHERE id = 'your-test-staff-id';
   ```

### Issue: Admin dashboard shows blank

**Cause:** Not logged in as admin or session expired

**Fix:**
1. Clear cookies
2. Login again as admin user
3. Check console for auth errors

### Issue: Staff portal shows no reviews

**Cause:** No reviews in UNDER_REVIEW or COMPLETED status

**Fix:**
1. Create reviews via admin trigger
2. Submit review via API
3. Process review as admin (changes to UNDER_REVIEW)
4. Now staff should see it

### Issue: Review submission fails

**Cause:** Wrong number of ratings for review type

**Fix:**
- Month 1: Exactly 18 ratings
- Month 3: Exactly 27 ratings
- Month 5: Exactly 24 ratings
- Recurring: Exactly 18 ratings

### Issue: Performance score not calculating

**Cause:** Ratings not properly submitted

**Fix:**
1. Verify ratings array in request
2. Check all ratings are 1-5
3. Verify count matches review type
4. Check API response for errors
