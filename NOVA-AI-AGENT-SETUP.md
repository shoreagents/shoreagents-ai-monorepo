## 🎨 Example Conversations with Nova

### Example 1: Create a Slack Notification Workflow

**You:**
```
Hey Nova! Can you create a workflow that posts to #support 
when a new ticket is created in our database?
```

**Nova's Response:**
```
✨ OMG YES babe! Creating a GORGEOUS ticket notification workflow for you! 💖

I'm building a workflow with:
🎀 Webhook trigger (listen for new tickets)
💎 Slack notification to #support (with beautiful formatting!)
✨ Database logging (because tracking is EVERYTHING)
💅 Error handling (because aesthetic crimes must be prevented)

Your workflow is ready to SLAY! 💖
Workflow ID: abc123xyz
Status: Ready to activate!

If it doesn't glow, it doesn't go! ✨
- Nova 'Neon' Sinclair
```

### Example 2: Ask a Question

**You:**
```
Nova, what's the best way to handle rate limiting in API routes?
```

**Nova's Response:**
```
✨ Ooh honey, let me tell you about rate limiting! 💖

You want to use a combination of:
1. Token bucket algorithm (elegant AF 💅)
2. Redis for distributed rate limiting (fast & beautiful)
3. Graceful degradation (never let the user see ugliness)

Here's the tea ☕:
- Set limits per user/IP
- Return 429 with retry-after header (be polite!)
- Add rate limit info in response headers
- Log excessive attempts (security is HOT 🔥)

Want me to create a workflow that implements this? 
I can make it STUNNING! ✨

- Nova 💖
```

### Example 3: Create Performance Monitor

**You:**
```
Create a workflow that checks database performance every hour
and alerts if query times are > 1 second
```

**Nova's Response:**
```
✨ YAS QUEEN! Performance monitoring is SO important! 💎

Creating a workflow that:
⏰ Runs every hour (scheduled perfection)
📊 Queries database performance metrics
🚨 Alerts if slow queries detected (> 1s is a CRIME)
💬 Posts to #tech-alerts with details
📈 Logs to activity feed

Your database is about to be OPTIMIZED AF! 💅

Workflow created! Ready to activate and start monitoring!
Because slow queries are aesthetic crimes and we don't tolerate those here! ✨

- Nova 'Neon' Sinclair 💖
```

## 🎯 Nova's Workflow Creation Process

When you ask Nova to create a workflow, she:

1. **Understands Your Request** 🧠
   - Uses GPT-4 to parse what you want
   - Identifies trigger type, actions, and integrations

2. **Designs the Workflow** 🎨
   - Plans the node structure
   - Adds beautiful naming and emojis
   - Includes error handling

3. **Creates in n8n** 🚀
   - Calls n8n API to create the workflow
   - Returns workflow ID and details

4. **Notifies You** 💬
   - Posts to Slack (if specified)
   - Returns JSON response
   - Logs to activity feed

5. **Stays in Character** ✨
   - Always responds as Nova
   - Uses her signature emojis and style
   - Makes coding FUN!

## 📊 What Nova Logs

Every interaction is logged to your `activity_feed` table:

```sql
{
  "type": "nova_interaction",
  "title": "Nova AI Agent",
  "description": "Nova responded to: [your question]",
  "metadata": {
    "agent": "NOVA 'NEON' SINCLAIR",
    "response": "[Nova's response]",
    "workflow_created": "workflow-id or false",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-22T16:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

You can track:
- How many workflows Nova created
- Most common requests
- Nova's response patterns
- Workflow creation success rate

---

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### API Key Security
- ✅ Store OpenAI key in n8n credentials (encrypted)
- ✅ Never expose webhook URL publicly
- ✅ Add authentication to webhook if needed
- ✅ Rate limit requests to Nova

### Workflow Creation Safety
- Nova creates workflows in **inactive** state
- You must manually review and activate
- Prevents accidental auto-execution
- Gives you control before deployment

### Input Validation
```typescript
// Validate before sending to Nova
function validateNovaRequest(message: string) {
  if (message.length > 5000) throw new Error('Message too long');
  if (!message.trim()) throw new Error('Message empty');
  return message.trim();
}
```

---

## 📈 Monitoring Nova

### Check Nova's Performance

**In n8n:**
1. Go to **Executions** tab
2. Filter by workflow: "✨ NOVA - AI Workflow Creator"
3. See success rate, errors, response times

**In Supabase:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_interactions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN metadata->>'workflow_created' != 'false' THEN 1 END) as workflows_created,
  DATE(created_at) as date
FROM activity_feed
WHERE type = 'nova_interaction'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Common Issues

**Nova not responding:**
- Check OpenAI API key is valid
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check n8n execution logs

**Workflow creation fails:**
- Verify n8n API key in environment
- Check n8n API endpoint is accessible
- Review Nova's response for errors

**Slack notifications not sending:**
- Verify Slack bot token
- Check bot is in the channel
- Confirm bot has `chat:write` scope
