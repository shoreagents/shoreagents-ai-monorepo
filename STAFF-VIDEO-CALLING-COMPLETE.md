## 🗄️ DATABASE SCHEMA

### VideoCalls Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE video_calls (
  id              UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  room_name       VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  room_url        TEXT NOT NULL,
  client_id       UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES client_users(id),
  staff_id        UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES staff_users(id),
  client_name     VARCHAR(255),
  staff_name      VARCHAR(255),
  status          VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'INITIATED',
  initiated_by    VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'client' or 'staff'
  started_at      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  answered_at     TIMESTAMP,
  ended_at        TIMESTAMP,
  duration        INTEGER,  -- in seconds
  recording_url   TEXT,
  
  INDEX idx_client_id (client_id),
  INDEX idx_staff_id (staff_id),
  INDEX idx_status (status)
);
```

### Call Status Enum

```typescript
enum CallStatus {
  INITIATED   // Call created, ringing
  RINGING     // Actively ringing
  ANSWERED    // Call accepted and ongoing
  ENDED       // Call ended normally
  MISSED      // Not answered in time
  DECLINED    // Recipient declined
}
```

## 🔄 HOW IT WORKS

### Client Calls Staff

```
1. Client clicks video button (bottom right)
2. Selects staff member from modal
3. POST /api/daily/create-room
   ├─ Creates Daily.co room
   ├─ Logs call to database (status: INITIATED)
   └─ Emits WebSocket: incoming-call → staff
4. Staff receives modal notification
   ├─ Shows caller name & avatar
   ├─ Plays ringtone (Web Audio API)
   └─ 30-second timer
5. Staff clicks "Accept"
   ├─ PATCH /api/video-calls/{callId}/status → ANSWERED
   ├─ Records answeredAt timestamp
   └─ Navigates to /call/{roomId}
6. Both parties in video call
7. Call ends
   ├─ PATCH /api/video-calls/{callId}/status → ENDED
   ├─ Records endedAt timestamp
   └─ Calculates duration
```

### Staff Calls Client

```
1. Staff clicks video button (bottom right)
2. Selects client from modal
3. POST /api/daily/create-room (initiatedBy: 'staff')
   ├─ Creates Daily.co room
   ├─ Logs call to database
   └─ Emits WebSocket: incoming-call → client
4. Client receives modal notification
5. Same flow as above
```

   ```
   Email: stephen@stepten.io
   Password: qwerty12345
   ```

   ```
   Email: sarah.test@test.com

## 📊 CALL HISTORY

### Future Features (Not in MVP)

```sql
-- Get call statistics for a staff member
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_calls,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'ANSWERED' THEN 1 END) as answered,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'MISSED' THEN 1 END) as missed,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'DECLINED' THEN 1 END) as declined,
  AVG(duration) as avg_duration_seconds
FROM video_calls
WHERE staff_id = 'uuid';
```

### UI Pages (Future)

- `/call-history` - View all past calls
- `/call-stats` - Analytics dashboard
- `/recordings` - Playback recorded calls

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: No incoming call notification

**Check:**
1. WebSocket connection: Open browser console, look for `[WebSocket] Connected`
2. User identification: Should see `[WebSocket] User identified: Name`
3. Room joining: Should see `User ... joined room: user:{userId}`
4. Server logs: Check for `📤 Sent incoming-call notification`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart server to reinitialize WebSocket
pnpm dev
```

---

### Issue: "Failed to create room"

**Check:**
1. `DAILY_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Daily.co account active
3. API key valid and not expired

**Test API Key:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.daily.co/v1/rooms
```

---

### Issue: Call connects but no video/audio

**Check:**
1. Browser permissions (camera/microphone)
2. HTTPS (Daily.co requires secure context)
3. Daily.co service status

---
