## üîë Key Features Implemented

### AI Assistant Features:
1. **Document Context Awareness**
   - AI can now access client-specific documents
   - Automatically includes relevant documents in context when answering questions
   - Shows which documents were referenced in responses

2. **Client-Specific Intelligence**
   - AI Assistant knows which client the user is viewing
   - Automatically filters and uses only relevant documents
   - Maintains context across conversation

3. **Document Upload Integration**
   - Staff can upload documents to client knowledge base
   - Documents are automatically indexed and made available to AI
   - Supports multiple file types

### Client Knowledge Base Features:
1. **Document Management**
   - Upload documents for specific clients
   - View all documents associated with a client
   - Delete/manage documents as needed

2. **Client Portal Access**
   - Clients can view their own documents
   - Secure access control (clients only see their own documents)
   - Clean, organized interface

---

## üìä Database Schema Changes

### Document Model Updates:
```prisma
model Document {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  title       String
  content     String   @db.Text
  clientId    String?
  client      Client?  @relation(fields: [clientId], references: [id])
  uploadedBy  String
  uploadedAt  DateTime @default(now())
  fileUrl     String?
  fileType    String?
  category    String?
}
```

### Key Relationships:
- Documents linked to specific clients
- Upload tracking (who uploaded, when)
- File metadata (type, URL, category)

---

## üîÑ API Endpoints

### 1. `/api/client/documents` (Staff)
- **GET**: Fetch all documents for a specific client
- **POST**: Upload new document for a client
- **DELETE**: Remove document
- Query params: `?clientId={id}`

### 2. `/api/documents` (General)
- **GET**: Fetch documents (with filtering)
- **POST**: Create new document
- Supports both staff and client access (with proper permissions)

---

## üé® UI Components Updated

### AI Chat Assistant (`components/ai-chat-assistant.tsx`)
- Shows document context in responses
- Real-time document fetching based on client
- Enhanced message display with document references
- Loading states for document operations

### Client Knowledge Base (`app/client/knowledge-base/page.tsx`)
- Document upload interface
- Document list view
- Delete functionality
- Category filtering
- Search capability

---

## üîí Security & Access Control

### Staff Access:
- ‚úÖ Can view all client documents
- ‚úÖ Can upload documents for any client
- ‚úÖ Can delete documents
- ‚úÖ Full AI Assistant access with document context

### Client Access:
- ‚úÖ Can only view their own documents
- ‚úÖ Can upload documents to their own knowledge base
- ‚ùå Cannot access other client documents
- ‚úÖ AI Assistant limited to their own documents

## üìã Linear Integration Setup

### What We Accomplished:
1. ‚úÖ Installed Linear CLI (`@linear/cli`)
2. ‚úÖ Set up Linear API access (API key configured)
3. ‚úÖ Created test issues successfully via command line
4. ‚úÖ Verified two-way sync capability

### Linear Issues Created:
1. **SHO-11** - "Setup Branch Protection & PR Workflow for Stephen"
   - URL: https://linear.app/shoreagents/issue/SHO-11
   - Status: Open
   - Timeline: Tomorrow

2. **SHO-12** - "Lovell Smells like cheese" (Test Issue)
   - URL: https://linear.app/shoreagents/issue/SHO-12
   - Status: Lovell is working on it üòÇ

### Linear API Configuration:
- **API Key:** `lin_api_***[REDACTED]***` (Stored securely)
- **Team ID:** `c5744c01-56b9-4f07-a09b-93f4f85c1ab9`
- **Team Name:** ShoreAgents
- **Plan:** Free (API access enabled)

## üß™ Testing Status

### What Needs Testing:
1. **AI Assistant Document Sync**
   - [ ] Test document upload for a client
   - [ ] Verify AI can access and reference documents
   - [ ] Check document context in AI responses
   - [ ] Test with multiple clients

2. **Client Knowledge Base**
   - [ ] Upload various file types
   - [ ] Verify client-specific access
   - [ ] Test delete functionality
   - [ ] Check search/filter features

3. **API Endpoints**
   - [ ] Test `/api/client/documents` GET/POST/DELETE
   - [ ] Test `/api/documents` endpoints
   - [ ] Verify authentication and authorization

### Server Status:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Server was running but terminal got into weird state
- üîÑ Need fresh restart to test changes
- üìç Port: 3000

## üîß Technical Details

### AI Assistant Implementation:
```typescript
// Document context is passed to AI
const documentsContext = documents.map(doc => ({
  title: doc.title,
  content: doc.content,
  category: doc.category
}));

// AI receives context in system message
systemMessage = `You are an AI assistant for ${clientName}.
Available documents:
${documentsContext.map(d => `- ${d.title}`).join('\n')}`;
```

### Document Upload Flow:
1. User selects file ‚Üí Frontend validates
2. File sent to `/api/client/documents` ‚Üí Backend processes
3. Document saved to database ‚Üí Linked to client
4. AI Assistant can now access ‚Üí Document in context
5. Client sees in knowledge base ‚Üí Full visibility

---

## üìù Environment Variables Required

### Current Setup:
```env
DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_***[REDACTED]***"
```

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Recommended)

### Immediate:
1. **Restart server cleanly** - Kill all node processes and fresh start
2. **Test document upload** - Upload a test document for a client
3. **Test AI integration** - Ask AI questions about uploaded documents
4. **Verify client access** - Test from client portal perspective

### Tomorrow (Per Linear Issue SHO-11):
1. **Set up branch protection** for MAIN branch
2. **Create stephen/dev branch** for development work
3. **Configure PR workflow** - No more direct commits to MAIN
4. **Enable branch rules** - Require reviews before merge

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Document versioning** - Track document updates
2. **Document categories** - Better organization
3. **Full-text search** - Advanced search capabilities
4. **Document analytics** - Track which docs AI uses most
5. **Bulk upload** - Upload multiple documents at once

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Notes

1. **Server Status:** Terminal got into weird state during restart
   - Solution: Clean kill of all node processes needed
   - Fresh `pnpm dev` required

2. **Document Sync:** Not tested yet in live environment
   - Need to verify end-to-end flow
   - Test with real client data

3. **GitHub-Linear Sync:** Not automatically working
   - GitHub issues created but don't auto-sync to Linear
   - Using Linear API directly instead (working)
