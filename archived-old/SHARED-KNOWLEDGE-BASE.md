# 📚 Shared Knowledge Base System

A **two-way document repository** that enables seamless knowledge sharing between offshore staff and their assigned client organizations.

## 🎯 Overview

The Shared Knowledge Base creates a synchronized document library where:
- **Staff members** (Maria Santos) can upload training materials, guides, and documentation
- **Client organizations** (TechCorp Inc.) can upload company policies, SOPs, and procedures
- **Both parties** can access, view, and reference all shared documents
- **Clear visual indicators** show who uploaded what

## 🔄 How It Works

### Document Flow

```
┌─────────────┐
│ Maria       │
│ (Staff)     │
└──────┬──────┘
       │ Uploads "Call Handling Tips"
       ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Document.create({                   │
│   userId: "maria-id",               │
│   title: "Call Handling Tips",      │
│   category: "TRAINING",             │
│   uploadedBy: "Maria Santos"        │
│ })                                  │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
               ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│ StaffAssignment.findMany({          │
│   userId: "maria-id",               │
│   isActive: true                    │
│ })                                  │
│ → Returns: clientId = "techcorp"   │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │
               ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TechCorp sees document with:        │
│ - Purple "Staff Upload" badge       │
│ - Read-only access                  │
│ - Full content available            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Database Relationships

```sql
User (maria-id)
  ↓
StaffAssignment
  ├── userId: maria-id
  ├── clientId: techcorp-id
  └── isActive: true
  
Document
  ├── userId: maria-id
  ├── title: "Call Handling Tips"
  └── category: "TRAINING"

-- Client query joins:
SELECT * FROM documents d
LEFT JOIN users u ON d.userId = u.id
WHERE d.userId IN (
  SELECT userId FROM staff_assignments
  WHERE clientId = 'techcorp-id'
    AND isActive = true
)
OR d.category = 'CLIENT'
```

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. **Database is Already Configured**
The `Document` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` already supports this feature:
```prisma
model Document {
  id          String           @id @default(uuid())
  userId      String
  user        User             @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  title       String
  category    DocumentCategory
  uploadedBy  String
  size        String
  fileUrl     String?
  content     String?
  createdAt   DateTime         @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime         @updatedAt
}
```

### 2. **No Additional Setup Required**
- API routes are ready ✅
- UI components are complete ✅
- Database relationships work ✅

### 3. **Test the System**

**As Staff (Maria):**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/ai-assistant`
2. Click "Upload Document"
3. Upload a training file
4. See success message: "🔄 This document is also visible to your client"

**As Client (TechCorp):**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/client/knowledge-base`
2. See Maria's document with **purple "Staff Upload" badge**
3. Click to view full content
4. Try to edit → See read-only notice

**Client Upload:**
1. Click "Upload Document" button
2. Fill in title, category, content
3. Submit → Document appears with **blue "Company Doc" badge**
4. Click to view → Edit and Delete buttons available

## 🎨 Design Patterns

### Color Coding
- **Purple (#A855F7)**: Staff uploads (indicates offshore worker)
- **Blue (#3B82F6)**: Client uploads (indicates company)
- **Gray (#6B7280)**: Category tags

### Icons
- 👤 `<User />`: Staff member
- 🏢 `<Building2 />`: Company/Organization
- 📄 `<FileText />`: Document
- 🔄 `<RefreshCw />`: Sync active

### Responsive Behavior
- Desktop: Sidebar always visible, full width layout
- Tablet: Toggle sidebar, responsive cards
- Mobile: Stack vertically, collapsible filters

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Documents are filtered by `StaffAssignment.clientId`
- Only assigned staff documents are visible
- Client can only modify their own documents

### Future Enhancements
- Add authentication middleware
- Implement row-level security
- Add document permissions/roles
- Enable document expiration dates

---

## 📊 Database Queries

### Get Client's Documents
```typescript
const assignments = await prisma.staffAssignment.findMany({
  where: { clientId, isActive: true },
  include: { user: true }
})

const staffUserIds = assignments.map(a => a.userId)

const documents = await prisma.document.findMany({
  where: {
    OR: [
      { userId: { in: staffUserIds } },        // Staff docs
      { category: "CLIENT" }                   // Client docs
    ]
  },
  include: { user: true }
})
```

### Check if Document is Staff Upload
```typescript
const isStaffUpload = staffUserIds.includes(doc.userId)
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Documents Not Showing for Client
1. Check `StaffAssignment.isActive = true`
2. Verify `clientId` matches
3. Ensure document `userId` is in assignment

### Can't Edit Staff Documents
**This is expected behavior!** Staff uploads are read-only for clients.

### Upload Dialog Not Showing Success
Check `document-upload.tsx` line 252 for the sharing message.
