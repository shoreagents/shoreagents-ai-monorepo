# ✅ ACTIVITY FEED - FIXED & ENHANCED - OCTOBER 20, 2025

## 🐛 **ISSUE FIXED:**

**Error:** `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'avatar')`  
**Cause:** API returned `staffUser` but frontend expected `user`  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## 🔧 **WHAT WAS FIXED:**

### **1. API Data Transformation** (`/app/api/posts/route.ts`)

**BEFORE:**
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "staffUser": { ... },           ← Wrong field name
      "reactions": [
        { "staffUser": { ... } }      ← Wrong field name
      ],
      "comments": [
        { "staffUser": { ... } }      ← Wrong field name
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**AFTER:**
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "user": { ... },                ← Correct field name
      "reactions": [
        { "user": { ... } }           ← Correct field name
      ],
      "comments": [
        { "user": { ... } }           ← Correct field name
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Code Added:**
```typescript
// Transform data to match frontend expectations (user instead of staffUser)
const transformedPosts = posts.map(post => ({
  id: post.id,
  content: post.content,
  type: post.type,
  images: post.images,
  createdAt: post.createdAt.toISOString(),
  user: {
    id: post.staffUser.id,
    name: post.staffUser.name,
    avatar: post.staffUser.avatar,
    role: post.staffUser.role
  },
  reactions: post.reactions.map(r => ({
    id: r.id,
    type: r.type,
    user: {
      id: r.staffUser.id,
      name: r.staffUser.name
    }
  })),
  comments: post.comments.map(c => ({
    id: c.id,
    content: c.content,
    createdAt: c.createdAt.toISOString(),
    user: {
      id: c.staffUser.id,
      name: c.staffUser.name,
      avatar: c.staffUser.avatar
    }
  }))
}))
```

### **2. Sidebar Label Updated** (`/components/sidebar.tsx`)

**BEFORE:** "Activity Log"  
**AFTER:** "Activity Feed"

More modern, clearer naming that matches the social feed vibe.
