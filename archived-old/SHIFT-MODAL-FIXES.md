# 🔧 Shift Modal & Clock-In Fixes

**Date:** Oct 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Duplicate Messages Removed
**Problem:** When clocking in, user saw:
- Alert() popup with "YOU'RE LATE!" 
- Styled modal with late message
- Break scheduler modal

**Fix:** Removed the debugging `alert()` calls from `handleClockIn()` in `components/time-tracking.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ Modals Now Show Sequentially
**Problem:** Both late modal AND break scheduler were appearing at the same time (overlapping)

**Fix:** 
- **If late:** Show late modal FIRST
- **After dismissing late modal:** Show break scheduler
- **If not late:** Show break scheduler immediately

**Changed Logic:**
```typescript
// Before: Both showed at once
if (data.wasLate) setShowLateModal(true)
if (data.showBreakScheduler) setShowBreakScheduler(true)

// After: Sequential
if (data.wasLate) {
  setShowLateModal(true)  // Show late first
} else if (data.showBreakScheduler) {
  setShowBreakScheduler(true)  // Or break scheduler if not late
}

// On late modal dismiss:
onAction={() => {
  setShowLateModal(false)
  if (pendingTimeEntryId && !breaksScheduled) {
    setShowBreakScheduler(true)  // Now show breaks
  }
}}
```

## Expected Behavior (NOT A BUG)

### ⚠️ "Already Clocked In Today" Message
**This is WORKING AS INTENDED:**

The system prevents multiple clock-ins per day. If you:
1. Clock in → Clock out → Try to clock in again **same day**
2. You'll get: "You have already clocked in today. Only one session per day is allowed."

This is the **one-session-per-day rule** you requested.

**API Check (in `/api/time-tracking/clock-in/route.ts`):**
```typescript
const todaysEntry = await prisma.timeEntry.findFirst({
  where: {
    staffUserId: staffUser.id,
    clockIn: {
      gte: startOfDay,  // 00:00:00 today
      lte: endOfDay     // 23:59:59 today
    }
  }
})

if (todaysEntry) {
  return "You have already clocked in today..."
}
```

**To allow multiple sessions per day:** Remove lines 30-51 in `clock-in/route.ts`

---

## Testing Checklist

1. ✅ Clock in late → See ONLY late modal → Click "Clock In Now" → See break scheduler
2. ✅ Clock in on time → See break scheduler immediately
3. ✅ Clock out → Try clock in same day → Get "already clocked in" error
4. ✅ No duplicate alert() messages
5. ✅ Modals don't overlap

---

## Files Modified

- `components/time-tracking.tsx` (lines 189-223, 612-623)

**Changes:**
- Removed alert() debugging calls
- Made modals show sequentially
- Late modal triggers break scheduler on dismiss

---

**Next Test:** Wait until tomorrow or manually clear today's time entry to test fresh clock-in flow! 🎉
