# üéØ Multi-Step Hire Flow Implementation

## Overview
Implementing a comprehensive hire flow system where candidates go through multiple stages from interview to hire, with proper status tracking and notifications.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1. Database Schema (Prisma)
- ‚úÖ Added new `InterviewRequestStatus` enum values:
  - `HIRE_REQUESTED` - Client/Admin wants to hire
  - `OFFER_SENT` - Job offer sent to candidate
  - `OFFER_ACCEPTED` - Candidate accepted offer
  - `OFFER_DECLINED` - Candidate declined offer
  - `HIRED` - Candidate created account and onboarding started

- ‚úÖ Added new fields to `InterviewRequest` model:
  - `hireRequestedBy` - Tracks who requested hire ('client' or 'admin')
  - `hireRequestedAt` - Timestamp of hire request
  - `clientPreferredStart` - Client's preferred start date
  - `finalStartDate` - Negotiated final start date
  - `offerSentAt` - When offer was sent to candidate
  - `offerResponseAt` - When candidate responded
  - `offerDeclineReason` - Reason if candidate declined

### 2. Backend APIs

#### ‚úÖ Admin Hire API (`/api/admin/recruitment/interviews/hire`)
- Changed from immediate hire to sending job offer
- Sets status to `OFFER_SENT`
- Creates `JobAcceptance` record (pending candidate acceptance)
- Returns offer acceptance link instead of signup link

#### ‚úÖ Candidate Offer Response API (`/api/offer/respond`)
- Allows candidate to accept or decline offer
- Updates status to `OFFER_ACCEPTED` or `OFFER_DECLINED`
- Records decline reason if applicable
- Returns signup link only after acceptance

#### ‚úÖ Offer Details API (`/api/offer/details`)
- Fetches job offer details for candidate review
- Returns company info, position, preferred start date
- Shows current status and whether candidate can still respond

#### ‚úÖ Client Hire Request API (`/api/client/interviews/hire-request`)
- Allows clients to request to hire a candidate
- Sets status to `HIRE_REQUESTED`
- Notifies admin of client's hire intent
- Includes client's preferred start date and notes

### 3. Frontend - Admin Portal

#### ‚úÖ Updated Interview Stats Cards
- Changed from 4 cards to 5 cards:
  - Pending Interviews
  - **Offers Pending** (NEW - shows HIRE_REQUESTED + OFFER_SENT)
  - **Offer Accepted** (NEW)
  - Completed
  - Hired
