# Client Portal - Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Overview

The Client Portal is now integrated into the Staff app as a separate interface accessible at `/client` routes. This allows companies like **TechCorp Inc.** to monitor their hired BPO staff (e.g., **Maria Santos**) with a clean, professional blue-themed UI.
