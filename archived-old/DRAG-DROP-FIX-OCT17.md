# 🔧 Drag-and-Drop Fix - October 17, 2025

## 🐛 Issue Found

**Error:** When dragging tasks, the status was being set to the **task ID** instead of the **status name**.

```
Invalid `prisma.task.update()` invocation:
{
  data: {
    status: "194aa0f8-b3e9-4968-81f9-bc7444c7d628"  // Wrong! This is the task ID
  }
}
Invalid value for argument `status`. Expected TaskStatus.
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

Added proper **DroppableColumn** components to both Kanban boards (Staff and Client), just like the Admin tickets system that works perfectly.

### What Changed

**Before:**
- `SortableContext` with `id={status}` was not creating proper drop zones
- `over.id` was returning the task ID instead of the column ID
- Drag-and-drop failed with Prisma validation error

**After:**
- Each column wrapped in `<DroppableColumn>` with `useDroppable({ id: status })`
- Proper drop zones established for each status column
- `over.id` now correctly returns the status ("TODO", "IN_PROGRESS", etc.)

### Files Fixed

1. **`components/tasks/staff-task-kanban.tsx`**
   - Added `useDroppable` import
   - Created `DroppableColumn` component
   - Wrapped each column with `<DroppableColumn>`

2. **`components/tasks/client-task-kanban.tsx`**
   - Same fixes applied for consistency

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Staff Portal Drag-and-Drop
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/tasks`
2. Drag a task from TODO → IN_PROGRESS
3. **Expected:** Smooth animation, task moves, toast "Success! 🎉"
4. **Result:** ✅ WORKS!

### Test 2: Client Portal Drag-and-Drop
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/client/tasks`
2. Drag a task between columns
3. **Expected:** Smooth animation, task moves
4. **Result:** ✅ WORKS!

### Test 3: Image Upload (Already Working)
- Created task "20 back flips" with 3 images
- Files uploaded to `staff/staff_task/` folder in Supabase
- Terminal log: `✅ staff 40e9dacc-7a92-469e-a33b-3c6e26dfae52 uploaded 3 task attachment(s) to staff/staff_task`

## 📋 Next: Task Detail Modal

**User Request:** "Task Card Model doesn't open and Relationships I don't see"

**What's Needed:**
1. Make task cards clickable
2. Show modal with:
   - Full task details (title, description, priority, deadline)
   - Relationship chain:
     - 👤 Created by: Staff/Client name + avatar
     - 👥 Assigned to: Staff members (with avatars)
     - 🏢 Company: Company name
     - 📅 Created/Updated dates
   - All attachments (clickable images)
   - Status and priority badges
3. Adaptive styling (light for Client, dark for Staff)

**Implementation:** Coming next...

## 🚀 Status

**Drag-and-Drop:** ✅ PRODUCTION READY  
**Task System:** ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL  
**Next Task:** Add detail modal with relationships
