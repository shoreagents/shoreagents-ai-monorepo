## 📊 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### How It Works

#### 1. Auto-Creation
- Admin clicks "Trigger Review Creation"
- System checks all staff `startDate` values
- Creates reviews 7 days before due date:
  - Month 1: Due at 30 days → Create at 23 days
  - Month 3: Due at 90 days → Create at 83 days
  - Month 5: Due at 150 days → Create at 143 days
  - Recurring: Due at 180 days → Create at 173 days
- Review status: PENDING

#### 2. Client Submission
- Client receives notification (future: email/in-app)
- Client submits via API:
  - Rates each question 1-5
  - Provides strengths (text)
  - Provides improvements (text)
  - Provides additional comments (optional)
- System calculates:
  - Overall score percentage
  - Performance level
- Review status: PENDING → SUBMITTED

#### 3. Admin Processing
- Admin sees SUBMITTED review in dashboard
- Admin clicks "View Details"
- Admin reviews client feedback
- Admin adds management notes (optional)
- Admin clicks "Mark as Reviewed"
- Review status: SUBMITTED → UNDER_REVIEW

#### 4. Staff Acknowledgment
- Staff sees "New Review" indicator
- Staff clicks "View Full Review"
- Staff reads feedback
- Staff clicks "Acknowledge Review"
- Review status: UNDER_REVIEW → COMPLETED

### Data Flow
```
startDate → Trigger Creation → Client Submits → Auto-Score
  ↓                                                   ↓
Admin Processes ← SUBMITTED ← ratings + feedback + score
  ↓                                                   
UNDER_REVIEW → Staff Acknowledges → COMPLETED
```
