**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**  
**All TODOs:** ✅ **COMPLETED** (40/40)

---

## 🚀 What's Been Built

### ✅ Complete Task Management System
- **3 Full Portals:** Client (light), Staff (dark fun), Management (view-only)
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Smooth animations with `dnd-kit` (FIXED!)
- **Bulk Task Creation:** Assign one task to multiple staff members
- **Image Uploads:** Up to 5 images per task (Supabase integrated)
- **Task Detail Modal:** Click any card to see full relationships

## 🔧 Latest Fixes (This Session)

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Bug FIXED ✅
**Problem:** Tasks were setting status to task ID instead of column ID  
**Solution:** Added `DroppableColumn` wrapper components to both Kanban boards  
**Result:** Perfect drag-and-drop, just like Admin tickets! 🎯

### 2. Task Detail Modal BUILT ✅
**Features:**
- **Click any task card** to open modal
- **Full relationship chain:**
  - 👔 Created by Client (if applicable)
  - 👥 Assigned to Staff (with avatars)
  - 🏢 Company info
- **All attachments** displayed as clickable images
- **Status, priority, source** badges
- **Deadline warnings** (overdue, urgent)
- **Adaptive theming:**
  - Dark gradients & glassmorphism for Staff
  - Clean light theme for Client

   - See company info

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Drag-and-Drop Fix
**Before:**
```tsx
<SortableContext id={status} items={...}>
  // Problem: over.id returned task ID
</SortableContext>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<DroppableColumn id={status}>
  <SortableContext items={...}>
    // Solution: over.id now returns status
  </SortableContext>
</DroppableColumn>
```

### Modal Integration
Each card now has:
1. `useState` for modal visibility
2. `onClick` handler on card div
3. `<TaskDetailModal>` conditional render
4. `isDarkTheme` prop for styling

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Bulk assign:** Select 10+ staff for one task - it works!
- **Upload images:** Up to 5 images, 5MB each
