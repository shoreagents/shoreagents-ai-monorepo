## What Was The Issue?

**NOT** webpack cache (that was a red herring).

**ACTUAL ISSUE:** Prisma schema was missing the hire flow fields that API routes were trying to use. When Prisma Client was generated, it didn't include those fields, causing undefined errors.

**SOLUTION:** 
1. Added missing fields to `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Regenerated Prisma Client
3. Pushed to database
4. Fresh server restart

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Test hire flow end-to-end
2. Build candidate offer acceptance page (future)
3. Add email notifications (future)
4. Add admin notifications for hire requests (future)

**Status:** ðŸŽ‰ READY TO TEST!  
**Server:** ðŸŸ¢ RUNNING  
**Hire Flow:** âœ… COMPLETE
