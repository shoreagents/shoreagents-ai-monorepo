# ✅ Implementation Complete - Data Isolation & 3-Portal System

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Backend Complete | ✅ Frontend Updated | ⏳ Testing Required

---

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented complete data isolation across all 3 portals (Staff, Client, Admin) with proper role-based access control and filtered data APIs.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Authentication & Authorization - COMPLETE

### Files Modified:
1. **`/app/admin/layout.tsx`**
   - ✅ Updated to allow both ADMIN and MANAGER roles
   - ✅ Redirects unauthorized users based on their role

2. **`/app/client/layout.tsx`**
   - ✅ Added authentication check for ClientUser
   - ✅ Verifies user exists in ClientUser table
   - ✅ Redirects non-client users to staff login

3. **`/lib/auth-helpers.ts`** (NEW)
   - ✅ `getStaffUser()` - Get staff members (STAFF or TEAM_LEAD)
   - ✅ `getAdminUser()` - Get admin/management (ADMIN or MANAGER)
   - ✅ `getClientUser()` - Get ClientUser from session
   - ✅ `getAssignedClient()` - Get client a staff member is assigned to
   - ✅ `getClientStaffIds()` - Get all staff IDs for a client

---

## ✅ Phase 2: Database Schema Updates - COMPLETE

### Prisma Schema Changes:

1. **ReviewStatus Enum - Updated**
   ```prisma
   enum ReviewStatus {
     PENDING_APPROVAL  // Client submits review
     APPROVED          // Admin approves
     FINALIZED         // Admin finalizes (visible to staff)
     ACKNOWLEDGED      // Staff acknowledges
     ARCHIVED          // Archived
   }
   ```

2. **Document Model - Enhanced**
   ```prisma
   model Document {
     // ... existing fields
     sharedWithAll Boolean   @default(false)
     sharedWith    String[]  @default([])
   }
   ```

3. **Review Model - Default Status**
   - Changed from `PENDING` to `PENDING_APPROVAL`

### Migration Status:
- ⚠️ Schema updated in `schema.prisma`
- ⏳ Migration pending due to DB connection issue
- 📝 Will be applied with `pnpm prisma db push` when DB is accessible

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Staff Portal APIs - COMPLETE (8 routes)

All Staff portal APIs now properly filter data to show ONLY the logged-in staff member's data:

| Route | Status | Filter Logic |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/time-tracking` | ✅ Fixed | Shows only current user's time entries |
| `/api/breaks` | ✅ Already OK | Shows only current user's breaks |
| `/api/tasks` | ✅ Already OK | Shows only current user's tasks |
| `/api/performance` | ✅ Already OK | Shows only current user's metrics |
| `/api/reviews` | ✅ Fixed | Shows ONLY FINALIZED reviews (not PENDING_APPROVAL) |
| `/api/tickets` | ✅ Already OK | Shows only current user's tickets |
| `/api/team` | ✅ Fixed | Shows only teammates on same client assignment |
| `/api/documents` | ✅ Fixed | Own uploads + documents shared with them |

### Key Changes:
- ✅ Time Tracking now uses `getStaffUser()` auth helper
- ✅ Reviews filtered to `status: "FINALIZED"` only
- ✅ Team shows only staff assigned to same client via `getAssignedClient()`
- ✅ Documents use new sharing fields (`sharedWithAll`, `sharedWith`)

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Client Portal APIs - COMPLETE (7 routes)

All Client portal APIs verify ClientUser authentication and filter to assigned staff only:

| Route | Status | Filter Logic |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/client/time-tracking` | ✅ Fixed | Shows all assigned staff time entries |
| `/api/client/breaks` | ✅ Created | Shows all assigned staff breaks |
| `/api/client/tasks` | ✅ Fixed | Shows/creates tasks for assigned staff only |
| `/api/client/monitoring` | ✅ Fixed | Shows performance metrics for assigned staff |
| `/api/client/reviews` | ✅ Created | Creates reviews with PENDING_APPROVAL status |
| `/api/client/documents` | ✅ Fixed | Own uploads + staff documents shared with them |
| `/api/client/staff` | ✅ Fixed | Shows only staff assigned to this client |

### Key Features:
- ✅ All routes verify `ClientUser` authentication
- ✅ Task creation validates staff assignment before allowing
- ✅ Reviews created with `PENDING_APPROVAL` status (requires admin approval)
- ✅ Documents use proper sharing logic via `sharedWith` fields

---

## ✅ Phase 5: Admin Portal APIs - COMPLETE (7 routes)

New admin APIs created to give full visibility with optional filters:

| Route | Status | Capabilities |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/admin/time-tracking` | ✅ Created | View ALL time entries, filter by staff/client/date |
| `/api/admin/breaks` | ✅ Created | View ALL breaks, filter by staff/client/date |
| `/api/admin/tasks` | ✅ Created | View ALL tasks, filter by staff/client/source/status |
| `/api/admin/performance` | ✅ Created | View ALL metrics, filter by staff/client/date |
| `/api/admin/reviews` | ✅ Created | View ALL reviews + approve/finalize workflow |
| `/api/admin/tickets` | ✅ Created | View ALL tickets, filter by staff/category/status |
| `/api/admin/documents` | ✅ Created | View ALL documents, filter by staff/client/source |

### Admin Review Workflow:
```javascript
// GET /api/admin/reviews - View all reviews (any status)
// PUT /api/admin/reviews - Approve or finalize reviews

// Actions:
{
  "action": "approve",    // PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED
  "action": "finalize",   // APPROVED → FINALIZED (now visible to staff)
  "action": "archive"     // Any status → ARCHIVED
}
```

---

## ✅ Phase 6: Frontend Updates - COMPLETE

### 1. Staff Portal - Reviews Component
**File:** `/components/reviews-system.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `ReviewStatus` type to include new statuses

- ✅ Changed filter tabs: "New" (FINALIZED), "Acknowledged", "Archived"
- ✅ Updated status colors for all 5 statuses
- ✅ Changed acknowledge button to show only for FINALIZED reviews
- ✅ Added "New Review" indicator for FINALIZED status

**User Experience:**
- Staff see ONLY reviews that admin has finalized

- Cleaner status labels ("New" instead of "Pending")

### 2. Staff Portal - Team Component
**File:** `/components/team-view.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `clientName` state from API response
- ✅ Updated header to show "{ClientName} Team"
- ✅ Updated description to show which client they're working on
- ✅ Handles case where no client is assigned

**User Experience:**
- Staff see ONLY teammates assigned to same client
- Clear indication of which client team they're viewing
- Empty state if no client assignment exists

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Database Migration:**
   - Schema is updated but migration not yet applied
   - Run `pnpm prisma db push` when DB connection is restored
   - May need to update existing review statuses

2. **Document Sharing:**
   - Uses new `sharedWithAll` and `sharedWith` fields
   - Staff can mark documents as shared with specific clients
   - Clients see own uploads + staff docs shared with them

3. **Review Workflow:**
   - 3-step process: CLIENT → ADMIN APPROVE → ADMIN FINALIZE → STAFF
   - Staff never see reviews until admin finalizes
   - Clients get immediate feedback that review was submitted

4. **Team Filtering:**
   - Based on `StaffAssignment.clientId`
   - Staff with no assignment see empty team
   - Staff with multiple assignments see all teammates across those clients

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend APIs - COMPLETE
2. ✅ Frontend Updates - COMPLETE
3. ⏳ **Apply Database Migration**
   ```bash
   pnpm prisma db push
   ```
4. ⏳ **Test 3-Way Flow:**
   - Login as Maria (Staff)
   - Login as Wendy (Client)
   - Login as Admin
   - Verify data isolation

5. ⏳ **Update Existing Data** (if needed):
   ```sql
   -- Update old review statuses
   UPDATE reviews SET status = 'FINALIZED' WHERE status = 'PENDING';
   
   -- Add default sharing fields to documents
   UPDATE documents SET "sharedWithAll" = false, "sharedWith" = '{}' WHERE "sharedWithAll" IS NULL;
   ```
