# 🏢 Company Assignment on Onboarding Complete

## ✅ WHAT WAS ADDED:

Added **Company/Client Assignment** during the "Complete Onboarding" process!

### 🎯 The Perfect Flow:

1. **Staff Signs Up** → No company assigned yet
2. **Staff Completes Onboarding** → Submits all docs (still no company)
3. **Admin Reviews & Approves** → Verifies all 5 sections
4. **Admin Assigns to Company** → Selects company from dropdown
5. **Admin Clicks "Complete Onboarding"** → Staff assigned + Profile created!

---

## 💡 WHY THIS MAKES SENSE:

**Before:** Didn't know when to assign staff to companies  
**Now:** Perfect timing = right after verification, before profile creation

### Benefits:
- Staff come in **individually** (freelance/open to any client)
- Admin reviews their skills/docs **first**
- Admin **then decides** which client to assign them to
- All happens in **one flow** - review → approve → assign → complete

---

## 📋 WHAT WAS CHANGED:

### 1. **Admin Detail Page UI** ✅
**File:** `app/admin/staff/onboarding/[staffUserId]/page.tsx`

**Added:**
- Company dropdown selector (shows all available companies)
- Label: "Assign to Company/Client *"
- Helper text: "Staff will be assigned to this company and the company will be billed for their time."
- Button now says: "Complete Onboarding & Assign to Company"
- Button disabled until company selected
- Fetches companies list on page load

**Before:**
```
✅ All Sections Verified & Approved!
[Complete Onboarding Button]
```

**After:**
```
✅ All Sections Verified & Approved!
All documents verified. Assign to a company and complete onboarding.

Assign to Company/Client *
[Dropdown: Select a company...]
Helper: Staff will be assigned to this company...

[Complete Onboarding & Assign to Company]
```

---

### 2. **Complete Onboarding API** ✅
**File:** `app/api/admin/staff/onboarding/[staffUserId]/complete/route.ts`

**Added:**
- Accepts `companyId` in request body
- Validates company exists before proceeding
- Updates `StaffUser.companyId` to link staff to company
- Sets `StaffProfile.client` to company name
- Sets `StaffProfile.accountManager` to company's account manager

**What Happens:**
```typescript
1. Receive companyId from request
2. Verify company exists in database
3. Assign staff to company:
   - StaffUser.companyId = companyId
4. Create profile with company data:
   - StaffProfile.client = company.companyName
   - StaffProfile.accountManager = company.accountManagerId
5. Create work schedule
6. Mark onboarding complete
```

---

### 3. **Companies API Endpoint** ✅ (NEW!)
**File:** `app/api/admin/companies/route.ts`

**Created new endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/companies`

**Returns:**
```json
{
  "companies": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-1",
      "companyName": "Acme Corp",
      "industry": "Technology",
      "location": "USA",
      "accountManagerId": "mgr-123"
    },
    {
      "id": "uuid-2",
      "companyName": "TechStart Inc",
      "industry": "SaaS",
      "location": "Australia",
      "accountManagerId": "mgr-456"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Security:**
- Requires admin authentication
- Only returns necessary fields
- Ordered alphabetically by company name

## 🔒 VALIDATION:

The API ensures:
1. ✅ Company ID is provided
2. ✅ Company exists in database
3. ✅ All 5 sections are approved
4. ✅ Profile doesn't already exist
5. ✅ Only admins can complete onboarding

**Error Handling:**
- Missing company → "Company ID is required"
- Invalid company → "Company not found"
- Not all approved → "All sections must be approved before completing onboarding"
- Profile exists → "Staff profile already exists"

**Answer:** YES! Perfect timing! They come in individually, get verified, THEN we assign them to a client. This flow makes complete sense! ✅
