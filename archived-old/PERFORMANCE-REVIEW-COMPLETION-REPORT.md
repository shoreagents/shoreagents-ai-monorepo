## üîß Technical Fixes Implemented

### Issue 1: Theme Consistency ‚ö°
**Problem:** Review pages had dark theme (`bg-background`) mismatching the light client dashboard

**Solution:**
- Changed `bg-background` ‚Üí `bg-gray-50` on both review pages
- Now perfectly matches the light theme of the client dashboard
- Applied to: `app/client/reviews/page.tsx` and `app/client/reviews/submit/[reviewId]/page.tsx`

**Commits:** 
- `10a78ff` - fix: Update review pages to match client dashboard light theme

---

### Issue 2: Star Rating Not Working ‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°
**Problem:** `TypeError: onChange is not a function` when clicking stars

**Root Cause:** Incorrect props being passed to `ReviewQuestionCard` component
- Was passing: `question={question.question}` (string instead of object)
- Was passing: `rating={}` (wrong prop name)
- Was passing: `onRatingChange={}` (wrong handler name)

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
<ReviewQuestionCard
  question={question.question}  // ‚ùå passing string
  rating={ratings[question.id]} // ‚ùå wrong prop name
  onRatingChange={(rating) => ...} // ‚ùå wrong handler name
/>

// AFTER (CORRECT)
<ReviewQuestionCard
  question={question}           // ‚úÖ passing full object
  value={ratings[question.id]}  // ‚úÖ correct prop name
  onChange={handleRatingChange} // ‚úÖ correct handler name
/>
```

**Additional Fixes:**
- Removed dual export pattern (named + default) from component
- Added force rebuild comments to trigger recompilation

**Commits:**
- `a8b8932` - fix: Correct ReviewQuestionCard component props to match interface
- `ee553f5` - chore: Remove debug console.log from ReviewQuestionCard

---

### Issue 3: Severe Webpack Caching ‚ö°
**Problem:** Code changes not reflecting despite server restarts

**Solution:**
- Killed all Node.js processes: `killall node`
- Cleared Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
- Started fresh dev server
- Multiple attempts required due to persistent caching

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

### Test Data Created
Successfully created 3 PENDING reviews for testing:

1. **John Doe** - Month 1 Review
   - Email: john.month1@test.com
   - Period: Day 1 to Day 25
   - Questions: 18 (Month 1 template)

2. **Emma Wilson** - Month 1 Review
   - Email: emma.month1@test.com
   - Period: Day 1 to Day 25
   - Questions: 18 (Month 1 template)

3. **Sarah Marie Johnson** - Month 3 Review
   - Email: sarah@test.com
   - Period: Day 1 to Day 85
   - Questions: 22 (Month 3 template)

### SQL Script Created
- File: `CREATE-TEST-REVIEWS.sql`
- Matched actual database schema (discovered Prisma schema was out of sync)
- Handled `PENDING_APPROVAL` status correctly
- Included proper JSONB arrays for answers field
- Generated UUIDs for review IDs

### Schema Issues Discovered
- Prisma schema defined `ReviewStatus.PENDING` but DB has `PENDING_APPROVAL`
- Prisma schema marked `overallScore` as optional but DB requires it
- Direct SQL approach bypassed Prisma issues
