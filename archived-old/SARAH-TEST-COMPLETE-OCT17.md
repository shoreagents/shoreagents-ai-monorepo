## 🛠️ **BUGS FIXED DURING TESTING**

### **1. Company Assignment Mismatch**
- **Issue:** Sarah Test was assigned to wrong StepTen company
- **Fix:** Updated Sarah's `companyId` to match stephen@stepten.io's company
- **SQL:** `UPDATE staff_users SET "companyId" = '9bea7147-3f51-4cee-89f6-f257feb0f691' WHERE email = 'sarah.test@test.com';`

### **2. Review Status Enum Values**
- **Issue:** Code used `PENDING_APPROVAL` and `SUBMITTED_PENDING_REVIEW` but database has `PENDING` and `SUBMITTED`
- **Fix:** Updated all API routes to use correct enum values
- **Files:** `app/api/client/reviews/route.ts`

### **3. Staff Assignment Model Removal**
- **Issue:** Code referenced non-existent `staffAssignment` model
- **Fix:** Removed all `staffAssignment` lookups from client review API

### **4. startDate Field Location**
- **Issue:** Code tried to select `startDate` from `staffUser` but it's in `staff_profiles`
- **Fix:** Removed `startDate` from all `staffUser` select statements
- **Files:** 
  - `app/api/client/reviews/route.ts`
  - `app/api/client/reviews/[reviewId]/route.ts`
  - `app/api/admin/reviews/route.ts`
  - `app/admin/reviews/[reviewId]/page.tsx`

### **5. Admin Review Filtering**
- **Issue:** Admin API didn't support filtering by `reviewId`
- **Fix:** Added `reviewId` query parameter support with exclusive filtering logic
- **File:** `app/api/admin/reviews/route.ts`
