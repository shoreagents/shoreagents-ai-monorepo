## üîç INVESTIGATION RESULTS

### ‚úÖ CURRENT BRANCH: `2-Bags-Full-Stack-StepTen`

**File:** `components/sidebar.tsx` (Line 35)

```typescript
const navItems = [
  { href: "/", icon: LayoutDashboard, label: "Dashboard" },
  { href: "/profile", icon: User, label: "My Profile" },
  { href: "/client-company", icon: Building2, label: "Client" },
  { href: "/onboarding", icon: ClipboardCheck, label: "Onboarding" }, // ‚úÖ CORRECT
  { href: "/team", icon: Users, label: "Staff" },
  { href: "/time-tracking", icon: Clock, label: "Time Tracking" },
  { href: "/analytics", icon: Activity, label: "Analytics" },
  { href: "/tickets", icon: Headphones, label: "Tickets" },
  { href: "/performance-reviews", icon: Star, label: "Performance Reviews" },
  { href: "/tasks", icon: CheckSquare, label: "Tasks" },
  { href: "/ai-assistant", icon: MessageSquare, label: "AI Assistant" },
  { href: "/activity", icon: FileText, label: "The Feed" },
  { href: "/leaderboard", icon: Trophy, label: "Leaderboard" },
  { href: "/settings", icon: Settings, label: "Settings" },
]
```

### ‚úÖ CLAUDE BRANCH: `claude-god`

**File:** `components/sidebar.tsx` (Line 35)

```typescript
const navItems = [
  { href: "/", icon: LayoutDashboard, label: "Dashboard" },
  { href: "/profile", icon: User, label: "My Profile" },
  { href: "/client-company", icon: Building2, label: "Client" },
  { href: "/onboarding", icon: ClipboardCheck, label: "Onboarding" }, // ‚úÖ CORRECT
  { href: "/team", icon: Users, label: "Staff" },
  // ... rest same as current branch
]
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ **SIDEBAR IS CORRECT!** Has "Onboarding"

**Difference from Current:**

- ‚ùå Does NOT have `fetchOnboardingStatus()`

**Verdict:** Current branch has MORE features than claude-god!

## üéØ CONCLUSION

### THE SIDEBAR IS CORRECT ON YOUR CURRENT BRANCH!

**What you're seeing is likely:**

1. **Browser Cache Issue** üåê
   - Old compiled JavaScript still in memory
   - Browser hasn't refreshed properly

2. **Hot Reload Issue** ‚ô®Ô∏è
   - Next.js dev server cached old version
   - Need fresh restart (already done)

3. **Confusion About Which Page** ü§î
   - Maybe looking at a different portal (Admin/Client sidebar)?

---

## üîß SOLUTION PLAN

### Option 1: Hard Refresh Browser (RECOMMENDED)
```
1. Open browser dev tools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Click "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or use Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
```

### Option 2: Check Which Sidebar File You're Looking At

**There are 3 different sidebars:**

1. **Staff Sidebar:** `components/sidebar.tsx` ‚úÖ (This is correct - has "Onboarding")
2. **Admin Sidebar:** `components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx` (Different file!)
3. **Client Sidebar:** `components/client-sidebar.tsx` (Different file!)

**ARE YOU LOOKING AT THE ADMIN SIDEBAR?** Let me check that...
