  - Lunch Break: 8:00 AM - 9:00 AM (60 min)  
  - Afternoon Break: 10:30 AM - 10:45 AM (15 min)
- **Throughout Day** - Timer runs, tracks active time
- **12:00 PM** - Clock out (select reason: "END_OF_SHIFT")

### APIs Used:
```

```

### Data Tracked:
```typescript
time_entries {
  clockIn: DateTime           // When shift started
