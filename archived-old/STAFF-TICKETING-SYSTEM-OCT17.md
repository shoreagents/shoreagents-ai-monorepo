## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Auto-Assignment Flow**
1. Staff selects category (e.g., "IT Support")
2. Frontend shows preview: "Will be assigned to: 💻 IT Department"
3. On submit, backend:
   - Maps category → department using `mapCategoryToDepartment()`
   - Finds first `managementUser` with matching `department`
   - Assigns ticket to that manager's ID
   - Logs success/failure
4. Ticket appears on Kanban with manager's profile image

### **Image Upload Flow**
1. Staff uploads images (max 3, 5MB each)
2. POST to `/api/tickets/attachments`:
   - Determines user type (staff/management/client)
   - Uploads to Supabase: `staff/staff_ticket/{userId}/`
   - Returns public URLs
3. URLs stored in `ticket.attachments` array
4. Can also add images later as responses

### **Styling Architecture**
- **Glassmorphism:** `bg-slate-900/50 backdrop-blur-xl ring-1 ring-white/10`
- **Gradients:** `bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-600 to-purple-600`
- **Shadows:** `shadow-lg shadow-indigo-500/50`
- **Hover effects:** `hover:scale-105 transition-all`
- **Rounded corners:** `rounded-2xl`, `rounded-xl`
