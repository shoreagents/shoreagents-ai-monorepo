## 📊 SCORING SYSTEM

**Rating Scale:** 1-5 per question
- 1 = Poor (Critical concern)
- 2 = Below Expectations
- 3 = Meets Expectations
- 4 = Exceeds Expectations
- 5 = Outstanding

**Overall Score Calculation:**
```typescript
totalEarned = sum(all ratings)
totalPossible = numberOfQuestions × 5
percentage = (totalEarned / totalPossible) × 100
```

**Performance Levels:**
- 0-49% = 🔴 CRITICAL (management alert)
- 50-69% = 🟡 NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- 70-84% = 🟢 GOOD
- 85-100% = 🔵 EXCELLENT

**Special Alerts:**
- Score < 50%: Flag for immediate management attention
- Month 5 Score < 70%: Regularization risk alert

## 📅 REVIEW TIMING (Based on startDate)

- **Month 1:** 30 days after startDate (create at 23 days)
- **Month 3:** 90 days after startDate (create at 83 days)
- **Month 5:** 150 days after startDate (create at 143 days) - REGULARIZATION DECISION
- **Recurring:** 180 days after startDate (create at 173 days)

POST /api/admin/reviews/trigger-creation
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```

This will:

- Create reviews for staff who are 7 days before due date
- Return count of created/skipped reviews

### Step 2: Test Client Submission
```bash
# Client opens pending review
GET /api/client/reviews?status=PENDING

# Client submits review
POST /api/client/reviews

  "reviewId": "xxx",
  "ratings": [4, 5, 3, 4, 5, ...], // 18-27 ratings depending on type
  "strengths": "Great communication skills...",
  "improvements": "Could improve time management...",
  "additionalComments": "Overall doing well"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Admin Processing
```bash

# Admin processes review
PUT /api/admin/reviews
Body: {
  "reviewId": "xxx",
  "managementNotes": "Discussed with staff, action plan created",
