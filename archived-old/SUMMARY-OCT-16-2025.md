# 📋 Summary - Tasks 3-Way Sync Investigation & Fix

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Issue:** `GET /api/client/tasks` failing with 500 error

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The API was failing because:
1. **Test users didn't exist** - Documentation referenced ceo@techcorp.com and wendy@techcorp.com but they weren't in the database
2. **Orphaned staff** - Maria Santos and Juan D had `companyId: NULL`
3. **Broken 3-way sync** - 13 tasks had `companyId: NULL`

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### Database Repairs
```
✅ Updated 13 tasks with missing companyId
✅ Assigned Maria Santos to TechCorp Inc.
✅ Assigned Juan D to ShoreAgents
✅ All tasks now properly linked for 3-way sync
```

### Created Test Users
```
✅ TechCorp Inc. company
✅ ceo@techcorp.com (John Smith, Owner)
✅ wendy@techcorp.com (Wendy Chen, Manager)
✅ Maria Santos assigned to TechCorp
```

### Verified API Works
```
✅ client@shoreagents.com → Returns 11 tasks
✅ ceo@techcorp.com → Returns 0 tasks (correct)
✅ API logic confirmed working
```
