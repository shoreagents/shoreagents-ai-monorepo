## ⚠️ Known Issues (Not Blocking)

### Database Schema Mismatch
- **Issue:** Code references `educationDocsUrl` field that doesn't exist in database
- **Impact:** Onboarding API endpoints return 500 errors
- **Affects:** 
  - `/api/onboarding`
  - `/api/onboarding/status`
  - `/api/welcome` (staff welcome form)
- **Fix Required:** Run schema migration or update API code to match current schema

### Temporary Workaround
For testing staff onboarding, you can:
1. Skip the welcome form for now
2. Test other features (dashboard, tickets, tasks, activity feed)
3. Fix schema mismatch later
