# 🔧 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED - October 19, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Client Document Upload (Line 184-191 Error)
**Problem:** `staffAssignment` table doesn't exist, was wrongly assumed  
**Fix:** Changed to direct `staffUser` lookup  
**File:** `app/api/client/documents/route.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
const firstStaff = await prisma.staffAssignment.findFirst({...})
staffUserId: firstStaff.staffUser.id
```

**After:**
```typescript
const firstStaff = await prisma.staffUser.findFirst({
  where: { companyId: clientUser.company.id }
})
staffUserId: firstStaff.id
```

### ✅ 2. AI Chat API User Lookup (Line 88-91 Error)
**Problem:** Trying to access `prisma.user.findUnique` but no `user` table exists  
**Fix:** Updated to check `StaffUser`, `ClientUser`, then `ManagementUser`  
**File:** `app/api/chat/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Check `staffUser` first using `authUserId`
- Fall back to `clientUser` if not staff
- Fall back to `managementUser` if not client
- Removed dependency on non-existent `user` table

---

### ✅ 3. Document Detail API Created
**Problem:** Client trying to view document detail but route didn't exist  
**Fix:** Created new API endpoint  
**File:** `app/api/client/documents/[id]/route.ts` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Fetch document by ID
- Include `staffUser` relation (not `user`)
- Proper auth check
- Error handling

---

### ✅ 4. Staff & Company List APIs Created
**Problem:** Admin upload modal couldn't fetch staff/client lists (404 errors)  
**Fix:** Created missing API endpoints  

**Files Created:**
- `app/api/staff/users/route.ts` - Returns all staff users
- `app/api/companies/route.ts` - Returns all client companies

## Next Steps Needed

### 🔶 Supabase Storage Buckets (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

**Required Buckets:**
- `staff_docs` - For staff document uploads
- `client_docs` - For client document uploads  
- `management_docs` - For admin document uploads

**Current State:**
- Documents only store text content extracted by CloudConvert
- `fileUrl` field is `null` - files not being saved to Supabase Storage
- Need to implement file upload to buckets AFTER CloudConvert extraction

**Storage Policies Needed:**
```sql
-- staff_docs bucket
CREATE POLICY "Staff can upload own docs"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'staff_docs' AND auth.uid() IN (
  SELECT "authUserId" FROM staff_users
));

-- client_docs bucket  
CREATE POLICY "Clients can upload own docs"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'client_docs' AND auth.uid() IN (
  SELECT "authUserId" FROM client_users
));

-- management_docs bucket
CREATE POLICY "Admin can upload docs"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'management_docs' AND auth.uid() IN (
  SELECT "authUserId" FROM management_users
));
```

### 🔶 Staff Docs Not Visible to Clients

**Problem:** When staff uploads doc, it's not syncing to client knowledge base  

**Current Behavior:**
- Staff uploads doc → stored with `source: 'STAFF'`
- `sharedWithAll: false` by default
- `sharedWith: []` is empty

**Expected Behavior:**
- Staff docs should auto-share with their assigned client company
- Need to populate `sharedWith` with `companyId` on upload

**Fix Needed in:** `app/api/documents/route.ts` (POST endpoint)

**Add after document creation:**
```typescript
// Auto-share with assigned company
if (staffUser.companyId) {
  await prisma.document.update({
    where: { id: document.id },
    data: { 
      sharedWith: [staffUser.companyId] 
    }
  })
}
```

### 🔶 Admin Upload Form - Staff/Client Lists Not Loading

**Status:** APIs created but may need server restart  
**Solution:** Restart dev server to compile new routes

## Files Modified Today

### Updated:
1. `app/api/client/documents/route.ts` - Fixed staffAssignment references
2. `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Fixed user lookup logic

### Created:
3. `app/api/client/documents/[id]/route.ts` - Document detail endpoint
4. `app/api/staff/users/route.ts` - Staff list endpoint
5. `app/api/companies/route.ts` - Company list endpoint
6. `FIXES-APPLIED-OCT19.md` - This file

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Completed Tests:
- [x] Admin doc upload works
- [x] Admin doc syncs to staff AI Assistant
- [x] Admin doc syncs to client knowledge base
- [x] AI chat connects (Claude API key working)

### ⏳ Pending Tests:
- [ ] Client doc upload (should work now after fix)
- [ ] Staff doc shows in client knowledge base (needs auto-share fix)
- [ ] Admin upload modal shows staff/client lists (needs server restart)
- [ ] Files upload to correct Supabase buckets (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

---

## Server Status

**Current:** Running on http://localhost:3000  
**Recommendation:** Restart to compile new API routes

```bash
lsof -ti :3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null
pkill -9 node 2>/dev/null
sleep 2
cd "/Users/stephenatcheler/Desktop/Electron - Staff/gamified-dashboard (1)"
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
nvm use 20 2>/dev/null
npm run dev
```

## Summary

**Fixed:**
✅ Client document upload
✅ AI chat API  
✅ Document detail view
✅ Staff/company list APIs

**Still Needed:**
🔶 Supabase Storage bucket uploads
🔶 Staff docs auto-share with clients
🔶 Test all upload flows end-to-end

**Status:** Core document system functional, storage layer pending
