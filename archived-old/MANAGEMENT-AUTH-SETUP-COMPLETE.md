   - CLIENT ‚Üí `/client`

### 4. API Endpoint ‚úÖ

## üë• FUTURE: ADDING YOUR TEAM

When you need to add managers to your team:

### Example: IT Manager
1. They go to `/login/admin/signup`
2. Fill out form:
   - Name: John Smith
   - Email: john@shoreagents.com
   - Department: **IT Department**
   - Role: **MANAGER**
3. Create account
4. **NOW:** They can login and access everything (same as you)
5. **LATER:** We'll add permission logic so IT Managers only see IT-related stuff

### Example: HR Manager
1. Same process
2. Department: **HR Department**
3. Role: **MANAGER**
4. **NOW:** Full access
5. **LATER:** They'll only see HR tickets, staff profiles, leave requests, etc.

---

## üéØ PERMISSION SYSTEM (FUTURE)

### Current Behavior:
- ‚úÖ Department is **stored** in database
- ‚úÖ Shows in user profile
- ‚ùå No permission restrictions yet
- ‚ùå All managers can see everything

### Future Implementation:
Once main features are built, we'll add permission checks:

```typescript
// Example: IT Manager trying to view HR ticket
if (user.department === "IT Department" && ticket.category === "HR") {
  return "Access Denied - HR tickets only visible to HR Department"
}
```

**Permission Matrix (To Be Built):**

| Department | Can See |
|------------|---------|
| CEO / Executive | Everything |
| IT Department | IT tickets, system settings, tech docs |
| HR Department | HR tickets, staff profiles, leave, reviews |
| Recruitment | Hiring, talent pool, applicants |
| Account Management | Clients, billing, contracts |
| Finance | Payroll, invoicing, budgets |
| Operations | Day-to-day ops, general oversight |
