- ❌ No role verification

**Pages Built:**
1. ✅ **Dashboard** (`/client`) - Client home page
2. ✅ **Staff** (`/client/staff`) - View assigned staff
3. ✅ **Staff Details** (`/client/staff/[id]`) - Individual staff member
4. ✅ **Reviews** (`/client/reviews`) - Review list

**🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES:**
1. **No Authentication:** Client layout doesn't check if user is logged in
2. **No Authorization:** Doesn't verify user is a CLIENT role
3. **No Data Isolation:** Doesn't filter data by client organization
4. **ClientUser vs User:** Uses `User` model, but should use `ClientUser` model

## 🔐 Current Authorization Model

### Admin Portal
```typescript
// app/admin/layout.tsx
✅ Checks: session exists
✅ Checks: role === "ADMIN"
✅ Redirects: Non-admin users to their portal
```

### Staff Portal
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
⚠️ No auth check at layout level
⚠️ Individual pages may check
```

### Client Portal
```typescript
// app/client/layout.tsx
❌ NO AUTH CHECK!
❌ Anyone can access
```

### API Routes

#### Admin APIs (`/api/admin/*`)
```typescript
✅ All routes check for ADMIN role
✅ Return 403 if not authorized
```

#### Client APIs (`/api/client/*`)
```typescript
✅ POST /api/client/reviews - Checks for session
⚠️ Does NOT verify CLIENT role
⚠️ Does NOT filter by organization
```

#### Staff APIs
```typescript
❌ No dedicated staff API routes yet
⚠️ Some pages use direct Prisma queries
```

## 🔄 Data Flow (What's Actually Implemented)

### Review Submission Flow

**Admin Side:**
- ✅ Admin can view all reviews via `/api/admin/reviews`
- ✅ Admin can send review request via `/api/admin/reviews/send`
- ⚠️ Email sending NOT implemented (no email service configured)

**Client Side:**
- ✅ Client can submit review via `/client/reviews/submit/[assignmentId]`
- ✅ Form posts to `/api/client/reviews`
- ❌ No auth check - anyone can submit
- ❌ No validation that client is assigned to that staff member

**Staff Side:**
- ⚠️ Staff cannot view their reviews yet
- ⚠️ No UI for staff to see review history

### Staff Assignment Flow

**Admin Side:**
- ✅ Admin creates `StaffAssignment` linking User ↔ Client
- ✅ Can view assignments at `/admin/assignments`

**Staff Side:**
- ⚠️ Staff can see their assignments (via API)
- 🔮 TO BE DECIDED: What can staff DO with this info?

**Client Side:**
- ⚠️ Client can see assigned staff at `/client/staff`
- ❌ No data filtering - shows ALL staff
- ❌ No auth/org isolation

---

## 🎯 What Works End-to-End

### ✅ Fully Functional Flows

1. **Admin Login**
   - Login → Check ADMIN role → Redirect to `/admin`
   - Can view all data
   - Can manage staff, clients, assignments

2. **Staff Time Tracking**
   - Staff clocks in/out
   - Data saved to `TimeEntry`
   - Admin can view all time entries

3. **Staff Tasks**
   - Staff creates tasks
   - Staff marks tasks complete
   - Admin can view all tasks

4. **Support Tickets**
   - Staff/Client creates ticket
   - Saved to database
   - Admin can view all tickets

### ⚠️ Partially Working Flows

1. **Review Submission**
   - ✅ Client can fill form
   - ✅ Data saves to database
   - ❌ No email notifications
   - ❌ Staff can't view their reviews
   - ❌ No auth/validation

2. **Document Management**
   - ✅ Upload works
   - ✅ Saved to database
   - ⚠️ Schema mismatch (fixed but needs testing)
   - 🔮 TO BE DECIDED: Who can see what docs?

3. **Staff Assignments**
   - ✅ Admin can create assignments
   - ✅ Links staff to client
   - 🔮 TO BE DECIDED: What does this enable?

### ❌ Not Working / Not Started

1. **Email Notifications**
   - No email service configured
   - No templates
   - No sending logic

2. **Client Portal Authentication**
   - No auth check
   - No org isolation
   - Security risk!

3. **Data Isolation**
   - Clients can see all data (not filtered)
   - Staff can see all data (no restrictions)

4. **ClientUser vs User Confusion**
   - Client portal uses `User` model
   - Should use `ClientUser` model
   - Login system not integrated

---

## 🔮 DECISIONS NEEDED

### 1. Client Portal Authentication
**Question:** How should clients log in?
- Option A: Use `ClientUser` model with separate auth
- Option B: Give `ClientUser` entries in `User` table with `CLIENT` role
- Option C: Different approach?

**Current State:** Not decided, not implemented

---

### 2. Staff Visibility
**Question:** Can staff see other staff members?
- In social feed? (Currently: YES)
- In leaderboard? (Currently: YES)
- Full profiles? (Currently: ?)
- Private data? (Currently: ?)

**Current State:** Partially visible, no clear rules

---

### 3. Review Visibility
**Question:** When can staff see their reviews?
- Immediately after client submits?
- After admin approval?
- After acknowledgment period?

**Current State:** Staff cannot see reviews at all

---

### 4. Document Permissions
**Question:** Who can see what documents?
- Can staff see all documents?
- Can clients upload documents?
- Can clients see only their documents?
- Can staff see client-specific documents?

**Current State:** No filtering, everyone sees everything

---

### 5. Task Assignment
**Question:** Who can assign tasks to whom?
- Can Team Leads assign tasks to their team?
- Can Managers assign tasks to staff?
- Can Clients assign tasks to staff?
- Can Admin assign tasks?

**Current State:** Only self-created tasks

---

### 6. Time Tracking Visibility
**Question:** What can clients see?
- Real-time tracking?
- Daily summaries?
- Weekly reports only?
- Screenshots/activity?

**Current State:** Client pages exist but no auth/filtering

---

### 7. Gamification Visibility
**Question:** Should clients see gamification?
- Engagement scores only?
- Full points/badges?
- No visibility?

**Current State:** Internal only, clients can't access

---

### 8. Staff Assignment Implications
**Question:** When staff is assigned to client, what happens?
- Can staff see client info?
- Can staff see client tasks?
- Can staff upload docs for client?
- Can staff clock time for client?

**Current State:** Assignment exists but no connected workflows

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX

### Priority 1: Security
1. ❌ **Client Portal has NO authentication**
2. ❌ **No data isolation between clients**
3. ❌ **API routes don't verify organization membership**

### Priority 2: Data Consistency
1. ❌ **ClientUser login not implemented**
2. ❌ **Review flow incomplete (staff can't view)**
3. ❌ **Document schema mismatch**

### Priority 3: Feature Completion
1. ⚠️ **Email notifications not implemented**
2. ⚠️ **Assignment workflows not connected**
3. ⚠️ **Analytics pages use mock data**

## 📋 Test User Accounts (What Actually Exists)

### System Admin
```
Email: sysadmin@shoreagents.com
Password: admin123
Role: ADMIN
Status: ✅ Works
```

### Staff Member
```
Email: maria@shoreagents.com
Password: password123
Role: STAFF
Status: ✅ Works
```

### Client User
```
Email: sarah@techcorp.com
Password: client123
Role: CLIENT (in User table)
Status: ⚠️ Can login but may not work correctly
Note: Should be in ClientUser table instead?
```

## 🎯 What to Document Next

Once you decide on the business logic, we need to document:

1. ✅ Authentication strategy (User vs ClientUser)
2. ✅ Data isolation rules (who sees what)
3. ✅ Assignment workflows (what assignments enable)
4. ✅ Review process (submission → viewing → acknowledgment)
5. ✅ Document permissions (visibility & access)
6. ✅ Task assignment rules (who can assign to whom)
7. ✅ Time tracking visibility (client access levels)
8. ✅ Notification triggers (when to send emails)

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Review this document** - Confirm what's actually built
2. **Make decisions** - Answer the 🔮 TO BE DECIDED questions
3. **Update specs** - I'll revise the flow documents based on your answers
4. **Implement gaps** - Fill in missing auth, data isolation, workflows
5. **Test end-to-end** - Verify all flows work correctly

**This document is the TRUTH of what exists right now.**  
**Everything else is assumptions and needs your input!** 🎯
