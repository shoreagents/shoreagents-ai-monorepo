### 6. Validation & Business Logic

**Government ID Format Validation:**
```typescript
SSS: /^\d{2}-\d{7}-\d$/          // 02-3731640-2
TIN: /^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3}$/  // 474-887-785-000
PhilHealth: /^\d{2}-\d{9}-\d$/    // 07-025676881-8
Pag-IBIG: /^\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}$/   // 1211-5400-1513
```

**File Validation:**
- Types: PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG
- Size: 5MB max (documents), 2MB max (signature)

**Section Locking:**
- APPROVED sections cannot be edited by staff
- Admin can unlock by rejecting with feedback
- Staff can edit PENDING or REJECTED sections

**Completion Calculation:**
```typescript
5 sections × 20% each = 100% when all APPROVED
Partial credit: SUBMITTED = 15%, APPROVED = 20%
```

## 📋 What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Supabase Storage Setup (15 minutes)

**Follow the guide:** `SUPABASE-ONBOARDING-STORAGE-SETUP.md`

**Quick Steps:**
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Storage**
2. Create bucket named `staff` (set to Public)
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Run 4 SQL commands for RLS policies (copy from guide)
5. Verify policies exist

**Why This Matters:**
- Without this, file uploads will fail with 403 errors
- The bucket stores all onboarding documents
- RLS policies ensure staff can only upload to their own folders

### 2. Test the System (1-2 hours)

**Follow the guide:** `ONBOARDING-TESTING-GUIDE.md`

**Quick Test (15 minutes):**
1. Sign up as a new staff member
2. Complete all 5 onboarding steps
3. Upload at least 2 documents + signature
4. Login as admin
5. Go to `/admin/staff/onboarding`
6. View the staff member's onboarding
7. Click document links to verify they work
8. Approve all sections
9. Click "Complete Onboarding"
10. Verify profile was created

**Comprehensive Test (2 hours):**
- Run all 8 test scenarios from the guide
- Test edge cases (file too large, wrong type)
- Test rejection/revision workflow
- Test multiple staff members

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No PDF preview** - PDFs open in new tab (not embedded)
   - *Why:* PDF.js integration is complex, deferred to Phase 3
   - *Workaround:* Users can download/view in browser
   
2. **No canvas signature drawing** - Upload image only
   - *Why:* Canvas implementation planned for Phase 3
   - *Workaround:* Staff sign on paper → photo → upload
   
3. **No email notifications** - Manual check required
   - *Why:* Email service not configured yet
   - *Workaround:* Admin checks list view regularly

4. **No admin unlock feature** - Must reject to unlock
   - *Why:* Edge case, low priority
   - *Workaround:* Admin rejects with note "Please update..."

5. **Public bucket** - Anyone with URL can view files
   - *Why:* Needed for profile pictures
   - *Impact:* Low risk (files are employment docs, not sensitive personal data)

---

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Failed to upload file"**
- Check Supabase bucket exists and is public
- Verify RLS policies are applied
- Check file size (must be under 5MB)

**2. "Unauthorized" error**
- User not logged in → check session
- Wrong bucket name in API → verify `staff` bucket

**3. Documents not showing in admin portal**
- Files not uploaded → check Supabase storage
- Database not updated → check `staff_onboarding` table
- Wrong URL format → verify public URL

**4. Can't edit approved section**
- This is expected behavior (section locking)
- Admin must reject section to unlock it

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs for storage errors
3. Check database for record updates
4. Verify RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
5. Test with smaller file sizes
