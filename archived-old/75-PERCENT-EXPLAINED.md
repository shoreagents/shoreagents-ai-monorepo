# Why You're Stuck at 75% (This is CORRECT!)

**75% = All sections SUBMITTED by staff** ✅

## 🐛 If Button Still Gets Stuck

### Check Browser Console (F12)

You should see these logs in order:

```
📝 Saving emergency contact...
Data: { emergencyContactName: "...", ... }
✅ Response received: 200 OK
✅ Save successful: { success: true, message: "..." }
🔄 Refreshing onboarding data...
✅ Onboarding data refreshed!
✅ Setting saving to false
```

### If It Stops Somewhere:

**Stops at "📝 Saving..."**
- Network issue
- API not responding
- Check terminal logs

**Stops at "✅ Response received: 500"**
- Server error
- Check terminal for error details
- Screenshot and send me

**Timeout (30 seconds)**
- Very slow connection
- Database slow
- Try again

**Works but shows 75%**
- **THIS IS CORRECT!** ✅
- Need admin approval for 100%

## 💡 Why This Design?

**Reason for 75% / 100% split:**

1. **Staff can't fake completion** - Admin must verify
2. **Rolling approval** - Admin can approve sections as they come in (don't need to wait for all 5)
3. **Quality control** - Admin checks documents are real/valid
4. **Clear workflow** - Staff submits → Admin verifies → Profile created
5. **Philippine HR compliance** - Proper document verification process
