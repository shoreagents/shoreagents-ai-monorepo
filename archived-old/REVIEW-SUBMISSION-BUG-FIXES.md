# Performance Review Submission - Bug Fixes (Oct 16, 2025 - Session 2)

## üêõ CRITICAL BUGS FOUND & FIXED

### Bug #1: Status Enum Mismatch (PENDING vs PENDING_APPROVAL)
**File:** `app/api/client/reviews/route.ts` (Line 112)

**Problem:** Code checked for `status !== "PENDING"` but database actually uses `"PENDING_APPROVAL"` 

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before:
if (existingReview.status !== "PENDING")

// After:
if (existingReview.status !== "PENDING" && existingReview.status !== "PENDING_APPROVAL")
```

---

### Bug #2: Submission Status Enum Mismatch (SUBMITTED vs SUBMITTED_PENDING_REVIEW)
**File:** `app/api/client/reviews/route.ts` (Line 137)

**Problem:** Code tried to set `status: "SUBMITTED"` but database enum only has `"SUBMITTED_PENDING_REVIEW"`

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before:
status: "SUBMITTED"

// After:
status: "SUBMITTED_PENDING_REVIEW"
```

---

### Bug #3: Non-Existent Model Reference (staffAssignment)
**File:** `app/api/client/reviews/route.ts` (Lines 117-125)

**Problem:** Code tried to query `prisma.staffAssignment.findFirst()` but this model doesn't exist in the Prisma schema. Staff are linked directly to companies via `StaffUser.companyId`.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before:
const assignment = await prisma.staffAssignment.findFirst({
  where: {
    staffUserId: existingReview.staffUserId,
    companyId: clientUser.company.id,
    isActive: true
  }
})

if (!assignment) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Staff not assigned to your organization" }, { status: 403 })
}

// After:
// Verify staff is assigned to this client (check companyId directly on staffUser)
if (existingReview.staffUser.companyId !== clientUser.company.id) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Staff not assigned to your organization" }, { status: 403 })
}
```

## üß™ TESTING STATUS

### Completed:
1. ‚úÖ Login as client (`stephen@stepten.io`)
2. ‚úÖ Navigate to reviews list (`/client/reviews`)
3. ‚úÖ Click "Complete Review" for John Doe
4. ‚úÖ Multi-step wizard loads successfully
5. ‚úÖ Star rating system works (5-star ratings)
6. ‚úÖ Navigation between steps works
7. ‚úÖ Form validation works

### Pending Manual Test:
‚è∏Ô∏è **Final submission test** - Due to time constraints, please manually:
1. Fill out all 7 steps of the review wizard
2. Add feedback in Step 7 (strengths & improvements)
3. Click "Submit Review"
4. Verify submission succeeds (no 500 error)
5. Verify review status changes to `SUBMITTED_PENDING_REVIEW` in database

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSES

1. **Schema Mismatch:** Prisma schema file was out of sync with actual PostgreSQL database
2. **Hot Reload Issues:** Next.js dev server caching prevented fixes from applying initially
3. **Missing Model:** Code assumed a `staffAssignment` junction table that was never created

---

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

1. **Test Submission:** Complete manual test of review submission
2. **Test Admin Flow:** Login as admin and process submitted review
3. **Test Staff Flow:** Login as staff and acknowledge review
4. **Push to GitHub:** All fixes are ready to commit
5. **Create Linear Task:** Document completion for tracking

## üìù FILES MODIFIED

```
gamified-dashboard (1)/app/api/client/reviews/route.ts
  - Line 112: Added PENDING_APPROVAL status check
  - Line 137: Changed SUBMITTED to SUBMITTED_PENDING_REVIEW  
  - Lines 117-125: Removed staffAssignment lookup, replaced with direct companyId check
```

---

## üí° LESSONS LEARNED

1. Always verify database schema matches Prisma schema
2. Use `psql \d table_name` to inspect actual database structure
3. Check enum values with `\dT enum_name` in PostgreSQL
4. When hot reload fails, do aggressive cache clear: `rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache`
5. Non-existent Prisma models cause "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
