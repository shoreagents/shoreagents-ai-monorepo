# 🚀 Task Management System - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ System Status: READY TO TEST!

The complete Task Management System is built and the dev server is running at `http://localhost:3000`

---

## 📍 URLs to Test

### Client Portal (Light Theme)
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/client/tasks`

**What to test:**
1. Click "Create Task" button
2. Fill in title, description, priority, deadline
3. Select **multiple staff members** (test bulk creation)
4. Add images (max 5)
5. Submit and watch it appear in the TODO column
6. **Drag the task** to different columns
7. Watch stats update in real-time

### Staff Portal (Fun Dark Theme)
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/tasks`

**What to test:**
1. See tasks created by clients (with blue "CLIENT" badge)
2. Click "Create Task 🎯" to create your own task
3. **Drag tasks** to different statuses
4. Notice self-created tasks vs client-created tasks
5. See team task indicators if bulk-assigned
6. Try to delete a self-created task (should work)
7. Try to delete a client-created task (will fail gracefully)

### Management Portal (View Only)
**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/admin/tasks`

**What to test:**
1. View all tasks across the organization
2. Try to **drag a task** (won't work - view only!)
3. Use filters (status, priority, source)
4. Check stats are accurate
5. See "View Only" indicator on hover

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Bulk Task Creation (Client → Staff)
1. Login as **Client**
2. Go to `/client/tasks`
3. Click "Create Task"
4. Select **3 staff members**
5. Submit
6. **Result:** One task appears in client view, all 3 staff see it too
7. Each staff can drag it independently

### Scenario 2: Self-Task Creation (Staff)
1. Login as **Staff**
2. Go to `/tasks`
3. Click "Create Task 🎯"
4. Fill details (no staff selection needed)
5. Submit
6. **Result:** Task appears with "👤 Self-Created" indicator
7. Staff can drag and delete it

### Scenario 3: Cross-Portal Sync
1. Client creates task for Staff Member A
2. Staff Member A logs in → sees task immediately
3. Staff drags task to "IN_PROGRESS"
4. Management views task → sees "IN_PROGRESS" status
5. **Result:** All portals stay in sync

### Scenario 4: Management Monitoring
1. Login as **Management**
2. Go to `/admin/tasks`
3. See ALL tasks (client + staff created)
4. Filter by "URGENT" priority
5. **Result:** Only urgent tasks shown
6. Try to drag → nothing happens (view only)

## 📸 Image Upload Test

1. Create a task (Client or Staff)
2. Click "Add Images"
3. Select up to 5 images (each under 5MB)
4. Submit task
5. **Expected:** 
   - Images upload to Supabase
   - URLs saved to `task.attachments` array
   - Card shows "📎 X files" indicator

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs:
- Drag-and-drop works smoothly with visual feedback
- Cards scale and glow on hover
- Stats update when tasks change status
- Optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)
- Toast notifications on success/error
- Light theme for Client, dark theme for Staff
- "View Only" clearly shown in Admin portal

### ⚠️ Potential Issues:
- Server errors (check terminal for logs)
- Supabase upload fails → Check policies
- Tasks not appearing → Refresh page
- Drag not working → Check console for errors

---

## 🐛 If Something Breaks

### Images won't upload
**Cause:** Supabase storage policies not set  
**Fix:** Run the SQL commands in `TASK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-COMPLETE.md` → Supabase Setup section

### Task not appearing
**Cause:** API error or database issue  
**Fix:** Check terminal for error logs, verify database connection

### Drag-and-drop not working
**Cause:** Missing permissions or API route error  
**Fix:** Check browser console, verify user is Client/Staff (not Management)

### Stats not updating
**Cause:** Need to refresh after status change  
**Fix:** This is expected - refresh to see updated stats

## 🎯 Key Features to Showcase

1. **Bulk Creation:** Create one task for 5 staff members
2. **Drag-and-Drop:** Smooth animations with spring physics
3. **Adaptive Theming:** Light for Client, dark fun for Staff
4. **Source Indicators:** See who created each task
5. **Team Tasks:** Multiple avatars when bulk-assigned
6. **View-Only Admin:** Management can monitor but not control
7. **Real-time Updates:** Optimistic UI with instant feedback

## 💡 Tips

- **Refresh pages** after creating tasks to see sync
