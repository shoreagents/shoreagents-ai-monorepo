## 🔐 Security & Permissions

### Access Control Matrix

| User Type | Own Docs | Admin Docs (shared) | Staff Docs | Client Docs | Comment | Edit/Delete |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|------------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Admin** | ✅ Create | ✅ View ALL | ✅ View ALL | ✅ View ALL | ❌ VIEW ONLY | ❌ VIEW ONLY |
| **Staff** | ✅ Full | ✅ View (if shared) | ✅ View (if assigned) | ✅ View (if assigned) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Own only |
| **Client** | ✅ Full | ✅ View (if shared) | ✅ View (if assigned) | ✅ View (if assigned) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Own only |

### Sharing Logic

**Admin Documents:**
- `sharedWithAll = true` → Visible to ALL staff and clients
- `sharedWith = [userId1, userId2]` → Visible only to selected users
- Supports mixing: staff IDs + company IDs in same array

**Staff Documents:**
- Automatically visible to assigned clients (existing logic)
- Can be shared with other staff (via `sharedWith`)

**Client Documents:**
- Automatically visible to assigned staff (existing logic)
- Private by default

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### Technical Insights
1. **Three-Way Data Sync**: Successfully merged 3 API sources with deduplication
2. **Permission Model**: Granular sharing works better than role-based for this use case
3. **CloudConvert**: Reliable for PDF/DOC extraction, 3-8s acceptable for UX
4. **Component Reusability**: Single badge component with theme variants = DRY code
5. **API Consistency**: Returning `source` field from all APIs enabled seamless integration

### UX Insights
1. **Color Hierarchy**: Red/Purple/Blue provides instant visual recognition
2. **Upload Progress**: Real-time feedback critical for 3-8s CloudConvert wait
3. **View-Only Clarity**: Explicit "VIEW ONLY" badge + disabled actions = clear UX
4. **Sharing Controls**: Multi-select with avatars > checkboxes for user selection
5. **Admin First**: Prioritizing admin docs in AI = establishes expertise authority

### Process Insights
1. **Schema First**: Starting with Prisma updates avoided rework
2. **API Before UI**: Having stable APIs made UI integration smooth
3. **Component Library**: Creating DocumentSourceBadge first saved time
4. **Dark/Light Variants**: Building both themes simultaneously = consistency
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple test flows ensure edge cases covered

---

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring Points
- CloudConvert API usage (check monthly limits)
- Database storage growth (documents + comments)
- API response times (especially 3-source fetching)
- Failed uploads (CloudConvert errors)

### Common Issues
1. **CloudConvert timeout**: Increase timeout for large PDFs
2. **Sharing not working**: Check `sharedWith` array format (string[])
3. **Badges not showing**: Verify `source` field in API responses
4. **Admin can't comment**: Expected behavior (view-only enforced)

### Admin Tasks
- Periodically review shared documents
- Monitor storage usage
- Clean up old/unused documents
- Update sharing permissions as staff/clients change

---

## 🎉 Final Notes
