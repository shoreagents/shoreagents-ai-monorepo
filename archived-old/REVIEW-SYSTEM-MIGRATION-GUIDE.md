## üìã PRE-MIGRATION CHECKLIST

Before running any commands, verify:

- [ ] You're in the correct directory: `gamified-dashboard (1)/`
- [ ] Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- [ ] npm is installed: `npm --version`
- [ ] Database is running (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)
- [ ] `.env` file has correct `DATABASE_URL`
- [ ] No uncommitted changes you want to keep

## üîß STEP 1: RUN PRISMA MIGRATION

### Option A: Create New Migration (Recommended)

```bash
cd "gamified-dashboard (1)"
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_performance_review_system
```

**What this does:**
- Creates a new migration file
- Updates your database schema
- Generates Prisma Client with new types
- Creates the `reviews` table
- Adds ReviewType and ReviewStatus enums

### Option B: Reset Database (Destructive - Use Only in Dev)

```bash
cd "gamified-dashboard (1)"
npx prisma migrate reset
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING:** This deletes ALL data and re-runs all migrations from scratch!

### Verify Migration

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

- Open Prisma Studio
- Check for `reviews` table
- Verify columns match schema

```

      type: "MONTH_1",

      reviewer: "client@example.com",

      evaluationPeriod: "First 30 days"
    }

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Migration Fails

**Error:** `Cannot find module './Either.js'`  
**Fix:** Update Prisma:
```bash
npm install @prisma/client@latest prisma@latest
npx prisma generate
```

**Error:** `Database schema is not in sync`  
**Fix:**
```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Review Creation Returns 0

**Cause:** No staff users have appropriate `startDate`  
**Fix:**
1. Check staff_users table has startDate values
2. Manually set startDate to 25 days ago for testing:
```sql
UPDATE staff_users 
SET startDate = DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 25 DAY) 
WHERE id = 'your-test-user-id';
```

### UI Not Showing Reviews

**Cause:** Authentication/permission issue  
**Fix:**
1. Check you're logged in as correct role
2. Verify API routes return data
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify session/auth cookies

### Scores Not Calculating

**Cause:** Ratings array mismatch  
**Fix:**
1. Ensure ratings array matches question count
2. Month 1: 18 questions
3. Month 3: 27 questions
4. Month 5: 24 questions
5. Recurring: 18 questions
