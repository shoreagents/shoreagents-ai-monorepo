## 🔍 Browser Console Logs

**Clock-In Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timeEntry": { ... },
  "wasLate": false,
  "lateBy": 0,
  "showBreakScheduler": true,
  "message": "Clocked in successfully"
}
```

**Clock-Out Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timeEntry": { ... },
  "totalHours": "7.50",
  "breakTime": "1.50",
  "message": "Clocked out successfully. Net work hours: 7.50"
}
```

---

## 📊 DATABASE TO CHECK

### `time_entries` table:
```sql
SELECT 
  "clockIn",
  "expectedClockIn",
  "wasLate",
  "lateBy",
  "clockOutReason",
  "breaksScheduled",
  "totalHours"
FROM time_entries
WHERE "staffUserId" = 'james-id'
ORDER BY "clockIn" DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected to see:**
- `expectedClockIn`: "2025-10-15 09:00:00"
- `wasLate`: false (since you're early!)
- `lateBy`: null
- `breaksScheduled`: true (after you schedule)

---

## 🎉 WHAT'S WORKING

### Frontend:
