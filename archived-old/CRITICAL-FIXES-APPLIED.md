# CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED 🔥

## The Bug
When staff completed all 5 onboarding sections (100%), the system was immediately setting `isComplete = true` in the database. This caused:
1. ❌ Admin list showing "✅ Verified & Complete" instead of "📋 Ready for Verification"
2. ❌ The "Complete Onboarding" form not appearing for admins (because isComplete was already true)

## Root Cause
**FIVE API routes** were automatically setting `isComplete = true` when staff reached 100%:
- `/api/onboarding/personal-info`
- `/api/onboarding/gov-ids`
- `/api/onboarding/documents/submit`
- `/api/onboarding/signature`
- `/api/onboarding/emergency-contact`

This logic was wrong! `isComplete` should ONLY be set by the admin when they click "Complete Onboarding".

## What Was Fixed
✅ **Removed `isComplete` auto-set from all 5 routes**
✅ **Unified completion logic: SUBMITTED or APPROVED = 20% per section**
✅ **Now `isComplete` is ONLY set by `/api/admin/staff/onboarding/[staffUserId]/complete`**

## How It Works Now

### Staff Side:
1. Staff completes all 5 sections → **100% completion**
2. Dashboard shows blue banner: **"⏳ Awaiting Admin Verification"**
3. List shows: **"📋 Ready for Verification"** (not "Verified & Complete")

### Admin Side:
1. Sees staff at 100% with **"📋 Ready for Verification"** badge
2. Clicks "View Details" → Reviews each section
3. Approves all 5 sections
4. **Green "Complete Onboarding" form appears** 💚
5. Fills employment details (company, salary, etc.)
6. Clicks "Complete Onboarding"
7. **NOW `isComplete = true` is set** ✅
8. Staff profile, personal records, work schedule created

## How to Test

### Step 1: Reset Kev's Data
Use the SQL script in `RESET-KEV-SQL.sql`:

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Run:
   ```sql
   SELECT id FROM staff_users WHERE email = 'kev@kev.com';
   ```
3. Copy Kev's UUID
4. Replace `'KEV_UUID_HERE'` in the script with actual UUID
5. Run the rest of the script
6. Verify: `completionPercent = 0`, `isComplete = false`

### Step 2: Staff Flow (as Kev)
1. Login as `kev@kev.com`
2. Complete all 5 onboarding sections
3. ✅ Should reach **100%**
4. ✅ Dashboard should show **blue banner** "Awaiting Verification"
5. ✅ Click banner → Goes to `/onboarding/status`

### Step 3: Admin Flow (as Stephen)
1. Login as admin
2. Go to **Staff Onboarding**
3. ✅ Should see Kev with **"📋 Ready for Verification"** badge
4. Click "View Details"
5. Approve all 5 sections (click Approve on each)
6. ✅ **Green "Complete Onboarding" form appears at top!**
7. Fill form:
   - Company: Select one
   - Employment Status: Probation
   - Start Date: Today
   - Shift Time: "9:00 AM - 6:00 PM"
   - Role: "Virtual Assistant"
   - Salary: 25000 (PHP)
   - HMO: toggle on/off
8. Click "Complete Onboarding"
9. ✅ Success message shows
10. ✅ Check Supabase:
    - `staff_onboarding.isComplete = true`
    - `staff_profiles` has new row
    - `staff_personal_records` has new row
    - `work_schedules` has new row

### Step 4: Staff View After Completion (as Kev)
1. Go back to Kev's dashboard
2. ✅ Blue banner should **disappear**
3. ✅ Can now access full dashboard

## Server Status
✅ **Server restarted with new code**
✅ **Pushed to GitHub (branch: full-stack-StepTen, commit: 31acd1c)**

---

## Next: Staff Visibility
The user also wants staff to **see what they submitted** (not just status badges). This is a separate task - I'll work on that next after confirming these fixes work!

Current status page shows:
- ✅ Status badges (Approved/Pending/Rejected)
- ✅ Admin feedback
- ❌ **MISSING: Actual submitted data** (name, address, gov IDs, docs, etc.)

Will add a "View My Submitted Data" section next!
