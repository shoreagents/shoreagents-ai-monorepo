# ðŸŽ‰ Multi-Step Hire Flow - Ready to Test!

## What's Been Implemented

### âœ… Database & Backend (100% Complete)
1. **New Interview Statuses:**
   - `HIRE_REQUESTED` - Client wants to hire (orange badge)
   - `OFFER_SENT` - Offer sent to candidate (indigo badge)
   - `OFFER_ACCEPTED` - Candidate accepted (emerald green badge)
   - `OFFER_DECLINED` - Candidate declined (red badge)
   - `HIRED` - Staff account created (purple badge)

2. **New Database Fields:**
   - Who requested hire (client/admin)
   - Hire request timestamp
   - Client preferred start date
   - Final negotiated start date
   - Offer sent/response timestamps
   - Decline reason

3. **New API Endpoints:**
   - `/api/admin/recruitment/interviews/hire` - Send job offer (not immediate hire anymore!)
   - `/api/offer/details` - View offer details
   - `/api/offer/respond` - Accept/decline offer
   - `/api/client/interviews/hire-request` - Client requests to hire

### âœ… Admin Frontend (80% Complete)
1. **Updated Stats Cards:**
   - Now shows 5 cards instead of 4
   - "Offers Pending" card shows HIRE_REQUESTED + OFFER_SENT count
   - "Offer Accepted" card shows candidates who accepted

2. **Updated Status Badges:**
   - All new statuses have color-coded badges
   - Badge text shows human-readable format (e.g., "OFFER SENT" not "offer-sent")

3. **Existing Hire Modal:**
   - Still works but now SENDS OFFER instead of immediate hire
   - Returns offer acceptance link (not signup link)

## ðŸ§ª How to Test Current Implementation

### Test 1: Admin Sends Offer
1. **Restart server** to pick up changes:
   ```bash
   # Kill all servers
   pkill -f "node.*server.js" && pkill -f "next dev"
   # Wait 3 seconds
   # Start server
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Login as Admin** (stephen@stepten.io)

3. **Go to Recruitment â†’ Interviews tab**

4. **Find Fran** (status: COMPLETED)

5. **Click "Hire" button**

6. **Fill in the modal:**
   - Position: "Virtual Assistant"
   - Company: Select "Noble Industries"
   - Email: fran@fran.com
   - Phone: +63 912 345 6789

7. **Click "Confirm Hire & Send Email"**

8. **Check the response:**
   - Should say "Job offer sent to candidate"
   - Status should change to OFFER-SENT (indigo badge)
   - You'll get an offer link (copy it!)

9. **Open offer link in new tab** (simulating candidate)

10. **Test the offer acceptance page** (to be built, but API works!)

### Test 2: Check Stats
1. **Go to Interviews tab**
2. **Look at stats cards:**
   - Should see "3 Pending"
   - Should see "1 Offers Pending" (Fran's offer)
   - Others should update accordingly

### Test 3: View Offer via API
```bash
# Copy the jobAcceptanceId from the hire response
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/offer/details?jobId=YOUR_JOB_ID"
```

### Test 4: Accept Offer via API
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/offer/respond \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jobAcceptanceId": "YOUR_JOB_ID",
    "action": "accept",
    "proposedStartDate": "2025-11-15"
  }'
```

After accepting, Fran's status should change to "OFFER-ACCEPTED" (emerald badge)!
