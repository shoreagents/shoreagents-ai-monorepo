## 📦 Supabase Setup

### **Storage Bucket Required**
Create a **public** storage bucket in Supabase:

```
Bucket Name: post-images
Public: ✅ Yes
File Size Limit: 10MB
Allowed MIME Types: image/*, application/pdf
```

### **RLS Policies**
The API uses `supabaseAdmin` (service role), so RLS is bypassed.
If you want to enable RLS for client-side access:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated uploads"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'post-images');

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'post-images');
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **File Upload Flow**
1. User selects images → previews generated with `URL.createObjectURL()`
2. Click "Post" → images uploaded to `/api/posts/images` first
3. Image URLs returned → included in post creation API call
4. Post created with image URLs stored in `images` array field

### **Reaction System**
- Uses unique constraint: `[postId, userId, type]`
- Toggle behavior: clicking same reaction removes it
- Real-time counts displayed next to each reaction icon
- Visual feedback: active reactions highlighted with color rings

### **Comment System**
- Comments include user info (name, avatar) via Prisma relations
- Users can only delete their own comments
- Comments sorted by creation time (oldest first)
- Real-time updates after adding/deleting

### **Performance**
- Posts limited to 50 most recent
- Images lazy-loaded with Next.js Image component
- Optimistic UI updates (could be added in future)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Images not uploading**
**Fix:** Ensure `post-images` bucket exists in Supabase Storage and is set to public.

### **Issue: "Unauthorized" errors**
**Fix:** Check that NextAuth session is valid. Restart dev server if needed.

### **Issue: Reactions not showing**
**Fix:** Verify `PostReaction` model exists in Prisma schema and run `prisma db push`.

### **Issue: Comments not loading**
**Fix:** Check browser console for API errors. Ensure `PostComment` model is in database.

---

## 🎨 Customization

### **Changing Reaction Icons**
Edit the `reactionIcons` object in `components/activity-log.tsx`:

```typescript
const reactionIcons = {
  LIKE: { icon: ThumbsUp, color: "text-blue-400", label: "Like" },
  // Add more or change colors
}
```

### **Adjusting Post Limit**
In `app/api/posts/route.ts`, change:
```typescript
take: 50, // Change to your desired limit
```

### **Modifying Upload Limits**
In `app/api/posts/images/route.ts`:
```typescript
const maxSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024 // Change size
if (files.length > 5) // Change file count
```

---
