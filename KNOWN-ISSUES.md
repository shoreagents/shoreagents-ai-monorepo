# 🐛 Known Issues - October 23, 2025

## ✅ Issue 1: Recruitment Interview Requests (500 Error) - **FIXED!**

### **Error:**
```
POST /api/client/interviews/request 500
relation "interview_requests" does not exist
```

### **Location:**
- `/api/client/interviews/request`
- Recruitment page when requesting interviews

### **Root Cause:**
- Database was not in sync with Prisma schema
- `interview_requests` table was missing in database
- Schema defined it, but table was never created

### **Fix Applied:**
```bash
npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss
npx prisma generate
```

### **Status:**
- ✅ **FIXED:** `interview_requests` table created
- ✅ Database synced with schema
- ✅ Prisma client regenerated
- ✅ Interview requests now work!

### **Impact:**
- 🎯 **CRITICAL:** This was blocking the FULL hire-to-work flow!
- Interview requests are the START of the journey that ends with GUNTING onboarding
- Now can test complete flow: Recruitment → Interview → Hire → Contract → Onboarding → Ready!

## ✅ Issue 2: ElectronProvider Warnings (Non-Critical)

### **Warning:**
```
A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true,
but the message channel closed before a response was received
```

### **Root Cause:**
- Browser extension conflict (likely Chrome DevTools or another extension)
- ElectronProvider checking for Electron environment
- Not an actual error in our code

### **Impact:**
- ⚠️ **NONE:** Just console noise
- Doesn't affect functionality
- Can be ignored

### **Fix:**
- Can be suppressed in production build
- Not worth fixing in dev environment
