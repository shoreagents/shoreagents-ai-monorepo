# ðŸŽ‰ Prisma Undefined Error - FIXED

## Issue Summary
The `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findUnique')` error was caused by incorrect Prisma client initialization in `lib/prisma.ts`.

## Root Cause
The code was using:
```typescript
const globalForPrisma = global as unknown as { prisma: PrismaClient }
```

This declared `prisma` as **required** (not optional), causing TypeScript/Webpack to treat it as always defined, which broke the fallback logic.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed `lib/prisma.ts`
Changed from:
- `global` â†’ `globalThis` (Next.js 15 RSC compatible)
- `{ prisma: PrismaClient }` â†’ `{ prisma: PrismaClient | undefined }` (optional type)
- `||` â†’ `??` (nullish coalescing)
- Removed logging config

### 2. Restored `app/client/layout.tsx`
- Reverted to using singleton `prisma` import from `@/lib/prisma`
- Removed direct `new PrismaClient()` instantiation
- Removed try/finally block

### 3. Cache Cleared
- Killed all Node processes
- Deleted `.next` directory
- Regenerated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
- Restarted dev server

## âœ… Server Status
**Server is now running successfully at:** `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing Instructions

### Test Client Recruitment Page
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/client/recruitment`
2. Login with: `stephen@stepten.io` / password
3. Verify:
   - âœ… Page loads without errors
   - âœ… Talent Pool tab shows candidates
   - âœ… Job Requests tab functional
   - âœ… **Interviews tab** displays interview requests

### Test Admin Recruitment Page
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin/recruitment`
2. Login as admin
3. Verify:
   - âœ… Candidates tab loads
   - âœ… Job Requests tab functional
   - âœ… **Interviews tab** shows all interview requests
   - âœ… Dark theme styling applied
   - âœ… Stats cards show correct counts
   - âœ… New hire flow statuses display:
     - PENDING
     - SCHEDULED
     - COMPLETED
     - HIRE_REQUESTED
     - OFFER_SENT
     - OFFER_ACCEPTED
     - OFFER_DECLINED
     - HIRED

## Key Files Changed
- `lib/prisma.ts` - Restored working Prisma singleton pattern
- `app/client/layout.tsx` - Reverted to use singleton import

## Why This Works
This is the **exact same pattern** used in james-branch and commit `bd957bf` that was working before. The `globalThis` + optional typing is the official Next.js 15 + Prisma recommendation.
