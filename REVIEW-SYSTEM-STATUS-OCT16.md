## üìã WHAT USER NEEDS NEXT

### Immediate Need

4. **TEST CLIENT FLOW** - Submit a review as client
5. **TEST ADMIN FLOW** - Process review as admin
6. **TEST STAFF FLOW** - Acknowledge review as staff

### Database Setup Required
```sql
-- Need to ensure:
-- 1. Staff exist in database
-- 2. Staff are linked to company owned by stephen@stepten.io
-- 3. Staff have startDate in their profile
-- 4. PENDING reviews exist for these staff
```

### Scripts Available

---

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS FOR NEXT SESSION

### Step 1: Clean Build
```bash
cd "gamified-dashboard (1)"
rm -rf .next
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Check for Compilation Errors
- Look at terminal output when `npm run dev` starts
- Check for missing imports in new files
- Verify all component dependencies exist

### Step 3: Verify Database State
```bash
npx prisma studio
# Check:
# - staff_users exist
# - staff_profiles have startDate
# - staff_assignments link to correct company
# - reviews table has PENDING reviews
```

### Step 4: Create Test Reviews Manually (if script fails)
```typescript
// Run in Prisma Studio or create new seed script
await prisma.review.create({
  data: {
    staffUserId: 'xxx',
    type: 'MONTH_1',
    status: 'PENDING',
    client: 'StepTen',
    reviewer: 'stephen@stepten.io',
    dueDate: new Date(Date.now() + 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
    evaluationPeriod: 'Nov 1, 2024 - Nov 30, 2024'
  }
});
```

4. **Don't over-explain** - User wants action, not lengthy explanations
5. **The "Trigger Review Creation" button is for LOCAL DEV ONLY** - Not part of client workflow
6. **Reviews should auto-create based on startDate** - This is for production (ignore Vercel cron in local dev)

---

## üìû USER'S LAST REQUEST

> "I want to log in as CLIENT: stephen@stepten.io, see pending reviews, submit one, then login as admin and process it, then login as staff to acknowledge it. The client creates the review by submitting it. Get the server working first!"
