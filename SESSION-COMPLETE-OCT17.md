## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### Server is Running ✅
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Test User (Staff):
- **Email:** james@james.com
- **Password:** qwerty12345
- **Name:** James Fredyy Smith

### Test Flow:

#### 1. **View Tasks:**
   - Go to `/tasks` (Staff Portal)
   - Click on any task card to open detail modal

#### 2. **Test Subtasks:**
   - Click "Add Subtask" button
   - Enter subtask title (e.g., "Review design mockups")
   - Press Enter or click "Add"
   - Check the checkbox to mark complete
   - Watch progress bar update in real-time
   - Add multiple subtasks to see 0% → 100% progression
   - Delete a subtask with trash icon

#### 3. **Test Comments:**
   - Scroll to Comments section
   - Type a comment in textarea
   - (Optional) Click "📸 Add Images" to attach files
   - Click "Post Comment"
   - See comment appear instantly with your avatar and "👤 STAFF" badge

#### 4. **Test Client Portal:**

   - Open a task
   - Add comments (will show "👔 CLIENT" badge)
   - Client can also create subtasks

## 📊 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### State Management:
- React hooks for local state (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Real-time fetching on modal open
- Optimistic UI updates
- Automatic progress recalculation

### API Integration:
- Fetch API for all requests
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Error handling with try/catch
- Loading states for all operations

### File Uploads:
- Reuses existing `/api/tasks/attachments` endpoint
- FormData for multipart uploads
- Supabase storage buckets:
  - Staff: `staff/staff_task/{userId}/`
  - Client: `client/client_task/{userId}/`

### Database Relations:
- `Task` → `TaskResponse[]` (one-to-many)
- `Task` → `Subtask[]` (one-to-many)
- Both use `onDelete: Cascade` for cleanup
