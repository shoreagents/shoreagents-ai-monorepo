## 🎨 Design System: Dark Admin Theme

**Consistent Styling to Apply:**
```tsx
// Main container
<div className="container mx-auto p-6 max-w-7xl">

// Cards
<Card className="rounded-lg bg-card border">

// Text colors
- Headings: text-foreground
- Body: text-muted-foreground
- Links: text-purple-400 hover:text-purple-300

// Buttons
<Button variant="outline" className="border-white/20 bg-white/5 text-white hover:bg-white/10">

// Select dropdowns
className="w-full rounded-lg border border-white/20 bg-white/5 px-3 py-2 text-sm text-foreground"

// Loading skeletons
<Skeleton className="h-8 w-full bg-white/10" />
```

## 📋 Key Technical Context

### Authentication Flow:
- Admin users stored in `managementUser` table
- Auth session via `auth()` from `@/lib/auth`
- Check: `managementUser.role === "ADMIN"` for admin access

### Database Models (Relevant):
- `StaffUser` - Staff members
- `Company` - Client companies
- `ClientUser` - Client portal users
- `ManagementUser` - Admin users
- `PerformanceMetric` - Electron tracking data (URLs, apps, screenshots)
- `TimeEntry` - Clock in/out with breaks
- `Break` - Break records with late tracking
- `Task` - Tasks with 3-way sync
- `Ticket` - Support tickets
- `Review` - Performance reviews
- `ActivityPost` - Social feed posts

### Critical Prisma Patterns:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Task query with assignees
where: {
  OR: [
    { staffUserId: userId },
    { assignedStaff: { some: { staffUserId: userId } } }
  ]
}

// ✅ CORRECT - Time entries
prisma.timeEntry.findMany({
  where: { clockOut: null } // Currently clocked in
})

// ✅ CORRECT - Activity posts
prisma.activityPost.findMany({
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
})
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Lowercase DB columns vs. camelCase Prisma
**Solution:** Use `@map` in schema
```prisma
visitedUrls Json? @map("visitedurls")
```

### Issue 2: Task assignee lookups
**Solution:** Check both `staffUserId` and `assignedStaff` relation
```typescript
task.staffUserId === userId || 
task.assignedStaff.some(a => a.staffUserId === userId)
```

### Issue 3: Position vs. currentRole
**Solution:** Staff role is in profile
```typescript
staffUser.profile?.currentRole || staffUser.role
```
