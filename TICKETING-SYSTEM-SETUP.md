## üéØ Category Mapping from ClickUp

Based on CSV analysis, here's how old ClickUp categories map to new system:

| Old Category | New Category | Count in CSV |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Computer/Equipment | EQUIPMENT or IT | ~500 |
| Station | STATION | ~80 |
| Surroundings (AC/Temp) | SURROUNDINGS | ~200 |
| Compensation (Food) | COMPENSATION | ~5 |
| Transport (Shuttle) | TRANSPORT | ~20 |
| HR Request/Payroll | HR | ~100 |
| Account Management | MANAGEMENT | ~50 |
| IT Support | IT | ~150 |
| Suggestion | OTHER | ~50 |

**Most Common Issues:**
- AC too cold/hot (SURROUNDINGS)
- Mouse/keyboard issues (EQUIPMENT)
- PC is slow (IT)
- RFID card issues (EQUIPMENT)
- Sprout access (HR)
