## 🔧 BUGS FIXED

### **1. Average Score Calculation Bug** 🐛 → ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Staff reviews page showing "33366700%" instead of "100%" for average score

**Root Cause:** PostgreSQL `Decimal` type from Prisma not being converted to JavaScript `number`, causing arithmetic errors in `.reduce()` calculation

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `app/api/reviews/route.ts`
- Added explicit `Number()` conversion for `overallScore` field
- Now correctly calculates: (100 + 100 + 100) / 3 = **100%**

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Convert Decimal fields to numbers for JSON serialization
const reviewsWithNumbers = reviews.map(review => ({
  ...review,
  overallScore: review.overallScore ? Number(review.overallScore) : null,
}))
```

---

### **2. Reviewer Field Mismatch** 🐛 → ✅ FIXED

**Issue:** Month 5 review not appearing in client's pending reviews list

**Root Cause:** Review created with `reviewer: 'Steve Batcheler'` but API filters by `reviewer: clientUser.email` (stephen@stepten.io)

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated review in database: `reviewer = 'stephen@stepten.io'`
- Review immediately appeared in client portal

## 📝 NOTES FOR POLISH/REFINEMENT

### **⚠️ REQUIRES ATTENTION:**

1. **UI Polish Needed:**
   - Client review wizard styling (currently functional but basic)
   - Admin review detail page layout
   - Staff modal spacing and typography
   - Responsive design testing
   - Loading states and animations

2. **Average Score Display:**
   - Now showing "100%" (fixed from "33366700%")
   - Should show **exactly how it's calculated** for clarity
   - Consider showing calculation: "(100 + 100 + 100) / 3 = 100%"

3. **Review Type Badges:**
   - Month 5 shows 🟣 (purple)
   - Should be more prominent/distinctive for regularization
   - Consider special styling for critical reviews

4. **Performance Stats:**
   - Trend calculation works but needs refinement
   - "stable" showing correctly
   - Consider visual chart/graph for performance over time

5. **Regularization Decision:**
   - Currently shows in admin notes and staff view
   - Should have dedicated "Regularization Decision" section
   - Employment status update should be automated
   - HR workflow integration needed

6. **Email Notifications:**
   - Not implemented
   - Staff should be notified when new review available
   - Admin should be notified when review submitted
   - Client should be notified when staff acknowledges

7. **Review Templates:**
   - RECURRING_TEMPLATE exists but not tested
   - Review scheduling automation not implemented
   - Due date reminders not implemented

8. **Data Validation:**
   - All required fields validated
   - Score calculation correct
   - Performance level mapping correct

9. **Security:**
   - Authentication working (Supabase Auth)
   - Authorization checks in place
   - Staff can only see UNDER_REVIEW and COMPLETED reviews
   - Clients can only see their assigned staff reviews

10. **Database Schema:**
    - Decimal conversion needed for JSON serialization (now fixed)
    - Consider adding indexes for performance
    - Review history tracking working
