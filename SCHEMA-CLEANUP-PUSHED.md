## Key Points for Testing

### The Issue You Hit:
**Server was running OLD Prisma Client** - it didn't have the new schema changes!

### Solution:
```bash
# MUST DO THIS after schema changes:
npx prisma generate
pnpm dev  # restart server
```

### What Should Happen Now:

#### Staff Side (John Smith):
1. Complete all 5 onboarding steps ‚Üí 100% complete
2. Blue banner: "Awaiting Admin Verification"
3. Can view status but can't re-submit approved sections

#### Admin Side (You):
1. See "John Smith - Ready for Verification" in list
2. Click ‚Üí Approve all 5 sections individually
3. "Complete Onboarding" button appears
4. Fill employment form:
   - Select Company (e.g., "Tech Corp")
   - Employment Status ‚Üí Probation
   - Start Date ‚Üí Today
   - Shift Time ‚Üí "9AM-6PM"
   - Role Title ‚Üí "Customer Support"
   - Salary ‚Üí 1200
   - HMO ‚Üí ‚úì
5. Click "Complete Onboarding"

#### What Gets Created in Database:
```sql
-- Updates StaffUser
UPDATE staff_users SET 
  name = 'John Michael Smith',
  companyId = 'selected-company-id'
WHERE id = 'john-id';

-- Creates StaffProfile
INSERT INTO staff_profiles (
  staffUserId, phone, location,
  gender, civilStatus, dateOfBirth,
  employmentStatus, startDate, currentRole, salary,
  daysEmployed, totalLeave, hmo
) VALUES (...);

-- Creates StaffPersonalRecord (NEW TABLE!)
INSERT INTO staff_personal_records (
  staffUserId,
  sss, tin, philhealthNo, pagibigNo,
  emergencyContactName, emergencyContactNo, emergencyRelationship,
  validIdUrl, birthCertUrl, nbiClearanceUrl, ...
) VALUES (...);

-- Creates WorkSchedule
INSERT INTO work_schedules (
  staffProfileId,
  dayOfWeek, shiftStart, shiftEnd
) VALUES (5 rows for Mon-Fri);
```

---

## Why It Didn't Work Before

1. **Server had OLD Prisma Client**
   - Didn't know about `staff_personal_records` table
   - Didn't have new fields on `staff_profiles`

2. **Migration was run BUT Prisma Client wasn't regenerated**
   - `prisma db push` ‚úÖ Database updated
   - `prisma generate` ‚ùå Client not regenerated
   - Server still using old types

3. **Solution:** Always run BOTH:
   ```bash
   prisma db push     # Update database
   prisma generate    # Update Prisma Client
   restart server     # Load new client
   ```

## Test Again Now!

### Step 1: Verify Server Has New Code
```bash
cd "/Users/stephenatcheler/Desktop/Electron - Staff/gamified-dashboard (1)"
npx prisma generate  # Generate new client
pnpm dev             # Start fresh server
```

### Step 2: Clear Test Data
- Delete John Smith's onboarding record in Supabase
- Delete uploaded files from `staff/staff_onboarding/{userId}/` bucket
- Start fresh flow

### Step 3: Staff Onboarding (John)
- Login as John
- Complete all 5 steps
- Verify reaches 100% with blue "Awaiting Verification" banner

### Step 4: Admin Verification (You)
- Login as admin
- Navigate to Staff Management ‚Üí Staff Onboarding
- Click John Smith
- Approve all 5 sections
- Fill employment form
- Click "Complete Onboarding"

### Step 5: Verify Database
Check Supabase:
```sql
-- Should have company assigned
SELECT name, companyId FROM staff_users WHERE email = 'john@test.com';

-- Should have demographics + employment
SELECT phone, gender, civilStatus, dateOfBirth, 
       employmentStatus, currentRole, salary 
FROM staff_profiles WHERE staffUserId = 'john-id';

-- Should have HR data (NEW!)
SELECT sss, tin, philhealthNo, pagibigNo,
       emergencyContactName, emergencyContactNo
FROM staff_personal_records WHERE staffUserId = 'john-id';

-- Should have 5 work schedules (Mon-Fri)
SELECT dayOfWeek, shiftStart, shiftEnd
FROM work_schedules WHERE staffProfileId = 'profile-id';
```
