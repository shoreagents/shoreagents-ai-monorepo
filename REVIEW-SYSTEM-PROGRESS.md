# 🎯 REVIEW SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS

**Started:** Now  
**Status:** Phase 1 & 2 & 3 COMPLETE ✅

## ✅ COMPLETED (Phases 1-3)

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅
- ✅ Updated `ReviewType` enum (MONTH_1, MONTH_3, MONTH_5, RECURRING)
- ✅ Updated `ReviewStatus` enum (PENDING, SUBMITTED, UNDER_REVIEW, COMPLETED)
- ✅ Updated `Review` model with new fields (ratings, strengths, improvements, managementNotes, etc.)
- ⏳ Migration pending (Prisma dependency issue - will run when user tests)

### Phase 2: Templates & Business Logic ✅
- ✅ Created `lib/review-templates.ts` with all 4 review types:
  - Month 1: 18 questions (6 categories)
  - Month 3: 27 questions (7 categories)
  - Month 5: 24 questions (5 categories)
  - Recurring: 18 questions (6 categories)
- ✅ Created `lib/review-utils.ts` with helper functions:
  - Performance level calculations
  - Badge configurations
  - Date formatting
  - Score validation
  - Trend analysis

### Phase 3: API Routes ✅

**Client Portal:**
- ✅ `POST /api/client/reviews` - Submit review
- ✅ `GET /api/client/reviews` - Get client's reviews (with status filter)
- ✅ `GET /api/client/reviews/[reviewId]` - Get specific review

**Admin Portal:**
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/reviews` - Get all reviews (with filters: staffId, clientId, status, type)
- ✅ `PUT /api/admin/reviews` - Process review (SUBMITTED → UNDER_REVIEW)
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/reviews/stats` - Dashboard statistics
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/reviews/trigger-creation` - Manual review creation trigger (local dev)

**Staff Portal:**
- ✅ `GET /api/reviews` - Get staff's reviews (UNDER_REVIEW + COMPLETED only)
- ✅ `POST /api/reviews/[id]/acknowledge` - Acknowledge review (UNDER_REVIEW → COMPLETED)
