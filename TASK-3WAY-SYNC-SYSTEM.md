# 3-Way Task Synchronization System

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive 3-way synchronization system for tasks across Staff, Client, and Admin portals. Tasks created in any portal are now visible across all three portals for seamless collaboration.

## Database Schema Changes

### Task Model Updates
```prisma
model Task {
  id            String       @id @default(uuid())
  staffUserId   String
  companyId     String?      // Links task to company for cross-portal visibility
  title         String
  description   String?
  status        TaskStatus   @default(TODO)
  priority      TaskPriority @default(MEDIUM)
  source        TaskSource   @default(SELF)
  createdByType CreatorType  @default(STAFF) // Who created this task
  createdById   String?      // ID of creator (StaffUser, ClientUser, or ManagementUser)
  assignedTo    String?      // Specific staff member if assigned
  deadline      DateTime?
  completedAt   DateTime?
  timeSpent     Int?
  tags          String[]
  createdAt     DateTime     @default(now())
  updatedAt     DateTime     @updatedAt
  staffUser     StaffUser    @relation(fields: [staffUserId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  company       Company?     @relation(fields: [companyId], references: [id], onDelete: SetNull)
}
```

### New Enum
```prisma
enum CreatorType {
  STAFF
  CLIENT
  ADMIN
}
```

## API Routes

### Staff Tasks API (`/api/tasks`)
- **GET**: Fetches all tasks for the current staff user (includes tasks from all sources)
- **POST**: Creates a new task with `createdByType: "STAFF"`
- Tasks are automatically linked to the staff user's company for visibility

### Client Tasks API (`/api/client/tasks`)
- **GET**: Fetches all tasks for staff assigned to the client's company
- **POST**: Creates a new task for a staff member with `createdByType: "CLIENT"`
- Validates staff is assigned to the client's organization

### Admin Tasks API (`/api/admin/tasks`)
- **GET**: Fetches ALL tasks across all companies with optional filters:
  - `staffId`: Filter by specific staff member
  - `companyId`: Filter by company
  - `source`: Filter by task source (SELF, CLIENT, MANAGEMENT)
  - `status`: Filter by task status
  - `createdByType`: Filter by creator type (STAFF, CLIENT, ADMIN)
- **POST**: Creates a new task for any staff member with `createdByType: "ADMIN"`

## Visual Indicators

Tasks now display a creator badge showing who created them:
- üë§ **Created by Staff** - Purple badge with border
- üëî **Created by Client** - Blue badge with border
- ‚ö° **Created by Admin** - Amber badge with border

These badges appear in both Board and List views on all three portals.

## How It Works

### Task Creation Flow:
1. **Staff Creates Task**:
   - Task is created with `staffUserId` set to the staff member
   - `companyId` is automatically linked from the staff user's company
   - `createdByType` is set to "STAFF"
   - Task is immediately visible to:
     - The staff member (in Staff Portal)
     - The client company (in Client Portal)
     - All admins (in Admin Portal)

2. **Client Creates Task**:
   - Client selects a staff member from their company
   - Task is created with `staffUserId` set to the selected staff
   - `companyId` is set to the client's company
   - `createdByType` is set to "CLIENT"
   - Task is immediately visible to:
     - The assigned staff member (in Staff Portal)
     - The client company (in Client Portal)
     - All admins (in Admin Portal)

3. **Admin Creates Task**:
   - Admin selects any staff member
   - Task is created with `staffUserId` set to the selected staff
   - `companyId` is automatically linked from the staff user's company
   - `createdByType` is set to "ADMIN"
   - Task is immediately visible to:
     - The assigned staff member (in Staff Portal)
     - The staff's client company (in Client Portal)
     - All admins (in Admin Portal)

### Visibility Rules:
- **Staff Portal**: Shows all tasks where `staffUserId` matches the logged-in staff user
- **Client Portal**: Shows all tasks where `companyId` matches the client's company
- **Admin Portal**: Shows ALL tasks across all companies (with optional filtering)

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: All stakeholders can see the same tasks
2. **Accountability**: Clear indication of who created each task
3. **Collaboration**: Clients and admins can assign tasks directly to staff
4. **Real-time Sync**: Tasks appear immediately across all portals
5. **Company Isolation**: Tasks are automatically scoped to the relevant company

## Testing

The system has been tested with:
- ‚úÖ Staff creating tasks (Michael Torres test user)
- ‚úÖ Database schema successfully updated
- ‚úÖ API routes functional with proper authentication
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators displaying correctly
- ‚è≥ Client portal task creation (ready to test)
- ‚è≥ Admin portal task creation (ready to test)
- ‚è≥ Cross-portal visibility (ready to test)

## Next Steps

1. Test task creation from Client Portal
2. Test task creation from Admin Portal
3. Verify cross-portal visibility with multiple users
4. Optionally add WebSocket support for real-time updates (currently using polling)
5. Add task assignment notifications
