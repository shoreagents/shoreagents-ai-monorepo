## Issues Fixed During Implementation

### Issue #1: Database Schema Mismatch
**Problem**: Database had old schema with `PENDING_APPROVAL` status and different column names
**Solution**: 
- Dropped and recreated `ReviewStatus` enum
- Added missing columns (dueDate, ratings, strengths, etc.)
- Changed overallScore from required to optional
- Fixed decimal precision to NUMERIC(5,2)

### Issue #2: Invalid Field in API Queries
**Problem**: API routes tried to select `startDate` from `StaffUser` model (doesn't exist)
**Solution**: Removed `startDate` from select queries in:
- `/api/client/reviews/route.ts`
- `/api/client/reviews/[reviewId]/route.ts`

### Issue #3: Missing Component Exports
**Problem**: ReviewQuestionCard and ReviewProgress used named exports but imports expected default
**Solution**: Added `export default` statements to both components

### Issue #4: Server Caching Issues
**Problem**: Dev server served stale cached code after fixes
**Solution**: Restarted server multiple times to pick up changes

### Issue #5: Empty Conflicting Routes
**Problem**: Empty route directories caused Next.js compilation errors
**Solution**: Deleted `/app/client/reviews/submit/[assignmentId]/` and `/app/client/reviews/[id]/`
