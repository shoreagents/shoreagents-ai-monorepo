# Client Authorization Security Fix

## Issue
Previously, anyone with any role (STAFF, ADMIN, etc.) could access `/client` routes, which should be restricted to CLIENT role only.

## Changes Made

### 1. Middleware Protection (`middleware.ts`)
Added role-based route protection:
- **Client routes** (`/client/*`) - Only accessible to users with `CLIENT` role
- **Staff routes** - Blocked for CLIENT users, redirecting them to `/client`
- Users with wrong roles are redirected to appropriate pages

### 2. Server-Side Layout Protection (`app/client/layout.tsx`)
Added double-check authorization:
- Server-side verification that user has `CLIENT` role
- Redirects non-CLIENT users to home page
- Acts as a backup layer if middleware is bypassed

### 3. API Route Protection
Created helper functions in `lib/api-auth.ts`:
- `verifyClientAuth()` - Ensures user has CLIENT role
- `verifyStaffAuth()` - Ensures user has STAFF or ADMIN role
- `verifyAuth()` - Basic authentication check

Updated the following API routes with CLIENT role verification:
- ✅ `app/api/client/staff/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/client/staff/[id]/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/client/tasks/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/client/tasks/[id]/route.ts` (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- ✅ `app/api/client/time-tracking/route.ts`

### 4. Additional API Routes That Need Protection
The following routes should also be updated (not yet done):
- `app/api/client/monitoring/route.ts`
- `app/api/client/documents/route.ts`
- `app/api/client/documents/[id]/route.ts`
- `app/api/client/breaks/route.ts`

## Security Layers

Now we have **3 layers of protection**:

1. **Middleware** - First line of defense, checks all routes
2. **Layout** - Server-side check before rendering any client pages
3. **API Routes** - Individual route protection with role verification

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Login as a STAFF or ADMIN user
2. Try to access `/client` routes
3. You should be redirected to `/`
4. Try to call `/api/client/*` endpoints
5. You should receive 403 Forbidden error

## Usage Example

For any new client API routes, use:

```typescript
import { verifyClientAuth } from "@/lib/api-auth"

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  // Verify client authentication
  const { session, error } = await verifyClientAuth()
  if (error) return error
  
  // Your route logic here
  // session.user will have the authenticated CLIENT user
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining client API routes with `verifyClientAuth()`
2. Consider similar protection for staff-only routes using `verifyStaffAuth()`
3. Add audit logging for unauthorized access attempts
4. Add unit tests for authorization logic
