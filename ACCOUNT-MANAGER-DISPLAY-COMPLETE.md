## Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Backend API - Added Account Manager Info
**File:** `app/api/client/tickets/route.ts`

- Modified GET endpoint to include account manager information

- Returns account manager details with each ticket

**What's included:**
```typescript
accountManager: {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  avatar?: string
  role: string
}
```

### 2. ✅ Type Definitions - Updated Ticket Interface
**File:** `types/ticket.ts`

- Optional field that includes full account manager details

### 3. ✅ Frontend - Create Ticket Modal

- Fetches account manager from first ticket
- Displays account manager info in create modal with:
  - Avatar (with fallback initials)
  - Name and role
  - Clear message: "This ticket will be assigned to: [Name] ([Role])"
  - Purple-themed info box

**Visual Design:**
- Purple background (`bg-purple-50`)
- Purple border (`border-purple-200`)

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. **Client loads tickets page** → Calls `/api/client/tickets`
2. **API fetches tickets** → Includes company + account manager
3. **Frontend receives data** → Extracts account manager from first ticket
4. **Store in state** → `accountManager` state variable
5. **Display in modal** → Shows when creating new ticket

### Account Manager Assignment
- Account managers assigned at **Company level**
- All client users in same company share same account manager
- Currently set via database script (will be integrated into client onboarding later)

## Known Limitations

### Current State
- ✅ Account manager display in create modal
- ⏳ Account manager display on ticket cards (simplified by user, can be re-added)
- ⏳ Account manager assignment during client onboarding (planned for future)

### Future Enhancements (As Mentioned by User)
1. **Client Onboarding Integration**
   - Automatically assign account manager during client signup
   - Allow management to change assigned account manager
   - Track account manager workload/client count

2. **Ticket Cards Enhancement**
   - Re-add account manager avatar/name to ticket cards
   - Show assignment status visually
   - Filter tickets by account manager (management view)

## Files Modified

1. `app/api/client/tickets/route.ts` - API with account manager data
2. `types/ticket.ts` - Type definition updated
3. `app/client/tickets/page.tsx` - Create modal with account manager display
4. `components/tickets/ticket-kanban-light.tsx` - Simplified by user (avatar imports added)

## Files Created

1. `ACCOUNT-MANAGER-DISPLAY-COMPLETE.md` - This documentation
2. `TESTING-SETUP-COMPLETE.md` - Testing setup documentation
3. `CLIENT-TICKETING-LIGHT-THEME-FIX.md` - Light theme fix documentation

## Server Status

✅ **Dev Server Running**
- URL: http://localhost:3000

2. **Future Development:**

   - Track metrics per account manager
