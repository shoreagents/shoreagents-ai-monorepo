- Natural incentive to complete (see what they're missing)

---

## Validation & Security

### Government ID Format Validation

```typescript
SSS: /^\d{2}-\d{7}-\d$/
TIN: /^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{3}$/
PhilHealth: /^\d{2}-\d{9}-\d$/
Pag-IBIG: /^\d{4}-\d{4}-\d{4}$/
```

### Access Control

**Staff:**
- ✅ Can only view/edit their own onboarding
- ✅ Cannot edit APPROVED sections (locked)
- ✅ Can edit PENDING or REJECTED sections
- ✅ Can access dashboard regardless of completion %

**Admin:**
- ✅ Can view all staff onboarding data
- ✅ Can approve/reject individual sections
- ✅ Can add feedback for rejected sections
- ✅ Can complete onboarding when 100% approved

---

## Data Flow

### New Staff Signup → Dashboard

1. Staff signs up at `/login/staff/signup`
2. Creates `staff_users` record
3. First login → Dashboard shows onboarding banner (0%)
4. Staff clicks banner → Redirects to `/onboarding`
5. Staff completes sections → Progress increases
6. Admin reviews & approves sections → Locks them
7. When 100% approved → Admin clicks "Complete Onboarding"
8. System creates:
   - `StaffProfile` with default values
   - `WorkSchedule` with Mon-Fri 9-6 template
9. Staff can now see full profile at `/profile`

---

## Completion Tracking

### Calculation

```typescript
const sections = [
  personalInfoStatus,
  govIdStatus,
  documentsStatus,
  signatureStatus,
  emergencyContactStatus
]

const approvedCount = sections.filter(s => s === "APPROVED").length
const completionPercent = (approvedCount / 5) * 100
```

### Status Badges

| Percentage | Badge | Color |
|------------|-------|-------|
| 0-20% | 🔴 Just Started | Red |
| 20-40% | 🟠 In Progress | Orange |
| 40-60% | 🟡 Halfway There | Yellow |
| 60-80% | 🟢 Almost Done | Green |
| 80-99% | 🔵 Pending Verification | Blue |
| 100% | ✅ Complete & Verified | Green |
