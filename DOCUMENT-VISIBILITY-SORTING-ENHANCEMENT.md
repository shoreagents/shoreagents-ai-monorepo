## 🎨 User Experience Benefits

1. **Clear Attribution**
   - Users instantly see **WHO** uploaded each document
   - No more generic "Staff Upload" or "Company Doc" labels

2. **Logical Ordering**
   - Each portal shows **their own docs first**
   - Client sees: *Client docs → Staff docs*
   - Staff sees: *Staff docs → Client docs*

3. **Visual Clarity**
   - Consistent color coding across both portals
   - Purple = Staff | Blue = Client
   - Easy to scan and identify document sources

4. **Sorted by Date**
   - Within each group (Staff/Client), newest documents appear first
   - Ensures users see the most recent updates immediately
