✅ URL: http://localhost:3000
✅ HTTP Response: 307 (Working)
✅ WebSocket: Active on ws://localhost:3000/api/socketio

## 🔧 FIXES APPLIED TODAY:

### **1. Interview Request API Fix** ✅
**Problem:** Raw SQL using snake_case column names that don't exist
```javascript
// ❌ BEFORE
client_user_id      // Column doesn't exist!
bpoc_candidate_id   // Column doesn't exist!
```

**Solution:** Use Prisma ORM with camelCase
```javascript
// ✅ AFTER
clientUserId        // Correct!
bpocCandidateId     // Correct!
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED & COMMITTED

### **2. Nova's Improvements Merged** ✅
- ✅ Break pause fields (isPaused, pausedAt, pausedDuration, pauseUsed)
- ✅ InterviewRequestStatus enum (PENDING, SCHEDULED, COMPLETED, HIRED)
- ✅ Enhanced interview fields (scheduledTime, meetingLink, adminNotes)
- ✅ WebSocket real-time events
- ✅ SQL migration files

**Status:** ✅ ALL MERGED & WORKING
