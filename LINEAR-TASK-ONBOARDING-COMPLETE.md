- âœ… File uploads to Supabase with proper RLS
- âœ… Staff reaches 100% on submission (blue banner stays visible)
- âœ… Admin verification portal with approve/reject for each section
- âœ… Green "Complete Onboarding" form appears after all 5 approvals
- âœ… All 4 database tables auto-populate (staff_users, staff_profiles, staff_personal_records, work_schedules)
- âœ… Comprehensive emoji logs track every step

**Known Issue (for later):** Staff dashboard empty after completion (demo data not linked to new users)

**Status:** PRODUCTION READY ðŸš€
