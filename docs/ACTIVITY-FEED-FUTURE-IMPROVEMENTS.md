# ðŸš€ Activity Feed - Future Improvements

## ðŸ“‹ Priority Rankings
- ðŸ”¥ **High Priority** - Should do soon (big impact, reasonable effort)
- âš¡ **Medium Priority** - Nice to have (good impact, moderate effort)
- ðŸ’¡ **Low Priority** - Future consideration (long-term value)

---

## ðŸ”¥ High Priority Improvements

### 1. **Pagination/Infinite Scroll** (Est: 1-2 hours)
**Problem**: Currently loading 50 posts + all reactions/comments at once = 5-8 second load times

**Solution**: Load 15 posts at a time
```typescript
// API changes
const page = parseInt(searchParams.get('page') || '1')
const limit = 15
const skip = (page - 1) * limit

const posts = await prisma.activityPost.findMany({
  skip,
  take: limit,
  // ... rest
})
```

**Frontend**: Add "Load More" button or infinite scroll with Intersection Observer

**Impact**: 
- Initial load: 5-8s â†’ 1-2s
- Better mobile experience
- Reduced database load

---

### 2. **Real-Time Feed Updates** (Est: 2-3 hours)
**Problem**: Users must refresh to see new posts/reactions/comments

**Solution**: Use existing WebSocket infrastructure
```typescript
// Server: Emit when post created
io.emit('activity:newPost', post)
io.emit('activity:newReaction', { postId, reaction })
io.emit('activity:newComment', { postId, comment })

// Client: Listen and update state
socket.on('activity:newPost', (post) => {
  setPosts([post, ...posts])
  showToast(`New post from ${post.user.name}`)
})
```

**Impact**:
- Feed feels alive
- Instant engagement feedback
- Better collaboration

---

### 3. **Tag Notifications** (Est: 2-3 hours)
**Problem**: Staff members don't know when they're tagged

**Solution**: Create notification system
```typescript
// When creating post with tags
if (taggedUserIds.length > 0) {
  await prisma.notification.createMany({
    data: taggedUserIds.map(userId => ({
      userId,
      type: 'TAG',
      postId: post.id,
      message: `${user.name} tagged you in a post`,
      read: false
    }))
  })
  
  // Emit WebSocket event
  taggedUserIds.forEach(userId => {
    io.to(`user:${userId}`).emit('notification', notification)
  })
}
```

**Database**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  "userId" TEXT NOT NULL,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  "postId" TEXT,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  "createdAt" TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**UI**:
- Badge on "The Feed" sidebar link
- Notification bell icon in header
- Mark as read when viewing post

**Impact**:
- Users never miss important mentions
- Better team communication
- Increased engagement

---

### 4. **Database Indexing** (Est: 30 minutes)
**Problem**: Queries are slow without proper indexes

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Speed up post fetching with audience filter
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_audience_created 
ON activity_posts(audience, "createdAt" DESC);

-- Speed up user's posts
CREATE INDEX idx_posts_staff_user_created 
ON activity_posts("staffUserId", "createdAt" DESC) 
WHERE "staffUserId" IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_posts_client_user_created 
ON activity_posts("clientUserId", "createdAt" DESC) 
WHERE "clientUserId" IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_posts_management_user_created 
ON activity_posts("managementUserId", "createdAt" DESC) 
WHERE "managementUserId" IS NOT NULL;

-- Speed up reaction lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_reactions_post_user 
ON post_reactions("postId", "staffUserId", "clientUserId", "managementUserId");

-- Speed up comment fetches
CREATE INDEX idx_comments_post_created 
ON post_comments("postId", "createdAt" ASC);
```

**Impact**:
- Faster queries (potentially 2-3x faster)
- Better scalability
- Reduced server load
