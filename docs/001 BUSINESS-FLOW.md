# 🚀 Shore Agents - Complete Business Flow

**The Modern BPO Platform**  
**Bridging the Gap Between Old BPO and Modern Technology**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT WE DO**

**We are a BPO company that sells Filipino staff to work full-time for clients, with us as management.**

**The Magic:** We bridge the gap of the OLD BPO system with transparency, technology, and AI.

---

## 🔥 **THE PROBLEM WITH OLD BPO**

| Old BPO | Shore Agents |
|---------|--------------|
| ❌ Wait 4 weeks for candidates | ✅ Browse talent pool instantly |
| ❌ No transparency (what is staff doing?) | ✅ Real-time performance tracking |
| ❌ Manual time tracking (trust-based) | ✅ Automated clock in/out + Electron tracking |
| ❌ Slow onboarding (weeks) | ✅ Fast digital onboarding (days) |
| ❌ No client visibility into operations | ✅ Client sees everything in real-time |
| ❌ Staff isolated, no support | ✅ AI Assistant + 24/7 knowledge base |
| ❌ No performance feedback loop | ✅ Automated monthly reviews |

```

**Key Feature:** Fast, easy, paperless onboarding. Client sees progress in real-time. Management approves each step.

---

## 🎉 **PHASE 3: DAY 1 - THE MAGIC HAPPENS!**

### **Staff's First Day:**

**Everything is already set up:**
- ✅ Work schedule captured during hiring
- ✅ Shift time locked in (e.g., 6:00 AM - 3:00 PM)
- ✅ Client knows staff is starting
- ✅ Management has everything ready

### **The Electron Desktop App (The Game Changer!):**

```
Staff downloads Shore Agents Desktop App (Electron)
    ↓
App runs in background
    ↓
TRACKS EVERYTHING:
├── Clock In/Out times (to the second)
├── Break times (scheduled + manual)
├── Mouse movements (activity detection)
├── Keyboard strokes (activity detection)
├── Active applications (what programs they're using)
├── URLs visited (work-related sites)
├── Screen time vs idle time
└── Productivity score (calculated from activity)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- 🔍 **Transparency:** Client sees staff is actually working
- 📊 **Proof of Work:** Real-time performance metrics
- 💰 **Accurate Billing:** Exact hours tracked
- 🎯 **Accountability:** No more "trust-based" time tracking

---

## ⏰ **PHASE 4: DAILY OPERATIONS (The Workflow)**

### **A. Time Tracking (Every Single Day)**

**Staff's Daily Routine:**

```
1. Staff arrives at desk (shift starts at 6:00 AM)

2. Opens Electron App → Clicks "Clock In"
   ├── System checks: On time? Late? Early?
   ├── IF LATE: "You're 15 min late. Why?"
   │   └── Staff selects reason (traffic, etc.)
   ├── IF EARLY: "Wow! You're 10 min early! 🎉"
   │   └── Bonus time recorded
   └── Timer starts ticking (real-time)

3. Work begins → Electron tracks activity

4. Break Time (scheduled or manual)
   ├── Staff clicks "Start Break"
   ├── Timer pauses
   ├── Client sees: "Staff is on break"
   ├── Can pause/resume break once (if work interrupts)
   └── Staff clicks "End Break" → Timer resumes

5. End of Shift
   ├── Staff clicks "Clock Out"
   ├── System checks: On time? Early?
   ├── IF EARLY: "You're leaving 30 min early. Why?"
   │   └── Staff selects reason + needs approval
   └── Shift complete → Summary displayed

6. Final Calculation:
   ├── Worked Full Shift? YES/NO
   ├── Total Hours: 9h 15m (includes bonus early time)
   ├── Breaks Taken: 1h 0m
   ├── Net Hours: 8h 15m (billable)
   └── Productivity Score: 87% (from Electron tracking)
```

**Who Sees What:**

| User | What They See |
|------|---------------|
| **Staff** | Own shift, breaks, hours, productivity |
| **Client** | Their staff's clock in/out, breaks, productivity, proof of work |
| **Management** | ALL staff, company-wide metrics, accountability |

---

### **B. Tasks System (Client Assigns Work)**

**How It Works:**

```
Client has work for staff:
    ↓
Client goes to "Tasks" tab
    ↓
Client creates task:
├── Title: "Design new landing page"
├── Description: "Use Figma template from docs"
├── Priority: High
├── Due Date: Tomorrow
├── Attachments: Figma file, brand guidelines
└── Assigned To: [Staff Name]
    ↓
Staff sees task in their "Tasks" tab
    ↓
Staff clicks task → Reads requirements → Starts work
    ↓
Staff updates task status:
├── Pending → In Progress → Completed
└── Can add comments, attachments, sub-tasks
    ↓
Client sees task progress in real-time
    ↓
Client marks as approved → Task closed
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Client assigns work directly to staff
- ✅ Staff knows exactly what to do
- ✅ Can bulk assign (multiple tasks at once)
- ✅ Staff can create personal tasks (self-organization)
- ✅ Management has visibility but **doesn't interfere** (client manages their staff)
- ✅ Subtasks for checklists (break big tasks into steps)

---

### **C. Support Tickets (Two Types!)**

#### **Type 1: Staff Tickets (Internal Issues)**

**Example:** Staff's mouse is broken, PC not working, need nurse visit

```
Staff creates ticket:
├── Category: IT / Equipment / Clinic / HR
├── Title: "Mouse not working"
├── Description: "Left click button stuck"
├── Priority: High
├── Attachments: Photo of mouse
└── Submit
    ↓
System AUTO-ASSIGNS to correct department:
├── IT issues → IT Manager
├── Equipment → IT Manager
├── Clinic → Nurse/Operations Manager
├── HR → HR Manager
└── Cleaning → Operations Manager
    ↓
Management sees ticket → Responds → Resolves
    ↓
Staff gets notification: "IT Manager replied: Coming in 5 min"
    ↓
Issue fixed → Manager marks "Resolved" → Ticket closed
```

**❗ IMPORTANT:** Client DOES NOT see staff internal tickets. This is management's job.

---

#### **Type 2: Client Tickets (Account/Relationship Issues)**

**Example:** "How do I give my staff a bonus?"

```
Client creates ticket:
├── Category: Account Support / Staff Performance / Bonus Request
├── Title: "How to give staff bonus?"
├── Description: "Staff did great work, want to give bonus"
└── Submit
    ↓
System AUTO-ASSIGNS to Account Manager
    ↓
Account Manager sees ticket → Responds:
"Great! Here's how:
1. Go to Staff Profile
2. Click 'Request Bonus'
3. Fill amount + reason
4. We process within 24h"
    ↓
Client replies: "Thanks! Done!"
    ↓
Account Manager closes ticket
```

**Key Difference:**
- Staff tickets = Internal operations (PC, nurse, HR)
- Client tickets = Account support (billing, features, how-to)

---

### **D. Performance Reviews (Automated Monthly Process)**

**The Review Cycle:**

```
MONTH 1: First Review (Critical!)
    ↓
Client receives notification: "Time to review [Staff Name]"
    ↓
Client fills out review:
├── Overall Rating: 1-5 stars
├── Punctuality: 1-5
├── Work Quality: 1-5
├── Communication: 1-5
├── Initiative: 1-5
└── Written Feedback: "Great work on XYZ project..."
    ↓
Client submits → Goes to Management
    ↓
Management reviews:
├── IF GOOD: Approve → Staff sees review → Celebrate! 🎉
├── IF CONCERNS: Take action (coaching, support)
└── Finalize review
    ↓
Staff sees review in their profile:
├── "Your client gave you 5 stars! 🌟"
├── Reads feedback
├── Knows what to improve
└── Feels valued

MONTH 3: Second Review (Check Progress)
MONTH 5: Third Review (Before Regularization)
MONTH 6: Regularization Review (CRITICAL)
    ↓
IF ALL GOOD: Staff becomes REGULAR (permanent)
IF CONCERNS: Extend probation or part ways
```

**This Happens AUTOMATICALLY!** System sends reminders, tracks progress, ensures no review is missed.

---

## 🤖 **PHASE 5: AI ASSISTANT (The Next Generation)**

### **Staff's AI-Powered Support (24/7)**

**The Problem AI Solves:**
- Staff gets stuck → needs help → but management is busy/asleep
- Time zones (Philippines vs US) make getting help HARD
- New staff need TONS of guidance initially
- Clients upload procedures → staff needs to understand them

**The AI Assistant:**

```
Staff opens AI Assistant tab
    ↓
AI already knows:
├── Who the staff member is
├── What tasks they're working on
├── What documents are in knowledge base
├── Company policies
├── Client's procedures
└── Staff's work history
    ↓
Staff asks: "How do I format the monthly report?"
    ↓
AI responds:
"I found the Monthly Report Template in your knowledge base!
Here's how to format it:
1. Use the template in Documents > Reports
2. Fill sections A-D with data from [Client System]
3. Client prefers bar charts (see Style Guide)
4. Submit by 5th of each month

Would you like me to create a task reminder for next month?"
    ↓
Staff: "Yes, create task"
    ↓
AI creates task: "Prepare Monthly Report - Due: Nov 5"
```

**Real-World Examples:**

**Example 1: Client Uploads New Procedure**
```
Client uploads: "New SEO Content Guidelines.pdf"
    ↓
AI ingests document → Adds to knowledge base
    ↓
Staff asks AI: "What's the new SEO process?"
    ↓
AI: "Client just uploaded new guidelines! Here are the key changes:
- Minimum 1500 words per article
- Include 3-5 internal links
- Focus keyword density: 1-2%
- Use H2/H3 headers for structure
Want me to create a checklist task for your next article?"
```

**Example 2: Management Shares New Policy**
```
Management uploads: "New Dress Code Policy.pdf"
    ↓
Staff asks AI: "What can I wear to the office?"
    ↓
AI: "According to the new Dress Code Policy:
Business casual is required:
✅ Collared shirts, blouses
✅ Slacks, chinos, skirts (knee-length)
❌ No shorts, flip-flops, tank tops

Casual Friday: Jeans + company shirt allowed.
Full policy: [Link to document]"
```

**Example 3: Staff Needs Help with Task**
```
Staff has task: "Set up Google Analytics for client website"
    ↓
Staff asks AI: "How do I set up Google Analytics?"
    ↓
AI: "I can help! Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. Log into client's Google account (credentials in Documents)
2. Go to analytics.google.com
3. Click 'Add Property'
4. Follow setup wizard
5. Copy tracking code
6. Client's developer will add to website

I found a video tutorial in your training materials: [Link]

Want me to add detailed steps as subtasks to your current task?"
```

**Why This is GENIUS:**
- 🌙 **24/7 Support:** AI never sleeps
- 🚀 **Instant Answers:** No waiting for manager to respond
- 📚 **Knowledge Base Access:** All docs, policies, procedures searchable
- 🎯 **Context-Aware:** AI knows what staff is working on
- 💰 **Cost-Effective:** AI << hiring 24/7 support team
- 🔥 **Game Changer for BPO:** Solves the remote worker support problem

---

## 🎉 **PHASE 6: SOCIAL FEED (Recognition & Engagement)**

### **The Social Layer:**

**Who Can Post:**
- ✅ Staff (share achievements, updates)
- ✅ Client (engage with staff, celebrate wins)
- ✅ Management (company updates, announcements)

**How It Works:**

```
SCENARIO 1: Staff Gets Great Review
    ↓
Staff receives 5-star review from client
    ↓
System asks: "Want to share this achievement?"
    ↓
Staff clicks "Share to Feed"
    ↓
Post appears in company feed:
"🌟 [Staff Name] just received a 5-star review from [Client]!
'Great work on the website redesign project!'"
    ↓
Other staff react: 🔥 15 reactions, 👏 8 reactions
Management comments: "Amazing work! Keep it up! 🎉"
Client comments: "You're a rockstar! 🌟"
    ↓
Staff feels VALUED → Motivation increases → Retention improves
```

```
SCENARIO 2: Client Wants to Engage
    ↓
Client creates post:
"Happy Holidays to my amazing team! 🎄
Thank you for all your hard work this year.
Looking forward to 2026 together!"
    ↓
Staff see post → React ❤️ → Comment "Thank you!"
    ↓
Builds team culture despite being remote
```

```
SCENARIO 3: Management Shares Update
    ↓
Management posts:
"📢 New Office Opening!
We're expanding to Cebu! 🎉
Applications open next month for Cebu-based roles."
    ↓
Staff see company growth → Feel part of something bigger
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Optional sharing (staff controls what to share)
- ✅ Recognition culture (celebrate wins publicly)
- ✅ Client engagement (builds relationship with staff)
- ✅ Company updates (everyone stays informed)
- ✅ NOT auto-posted (no spam, user-controlled feed)

---

## 💬 **UNIVERSAL COMMENTS & REACTIONS (One System for Everything)**

### **The Design:**

**Instead of:**
```
❌ Ticket comments (separate system)
❌ Task comments (separate system)
❌ Document comments (separate system)
❌ Post comments (separate system)
```

**We have:**
```
✅ ONE comments table for EVERYTHING
✅ ONE reactions table for EVERYTHING
```

**How It Works:**

```
ANY entity in the system:
├── Ticket
├── Task
├── Document
├── Post
├── Onboarding step
├── Job acceptance
├── Performance review
├── Time entry
└── Staff profile
    ↓
Can have:
├── Comments (threaded conversations)
└── Reactions (👍 ❤️ 🔥 🎉 👏 😂 💩 🚀 😱 🤯)
```

**Example: Ticket with Comments**
```
Staff creates ticket: "PC not working"
    ↓
IT Manager comments: "I'll be there in 5 minutes"
    ↓
Staff reacts: 👍
    ↓
IT Manager comments: "Fixed! Was a loose cable."
    ↓
Staff comments: "Thank you so much! 🙏"
    ↓
Staff reacts to comment: 🔥
    ↓
Manager closes ticket
```

**Example: Task with Comments**
```
Client assigns task: "Update website copy"
    ↓
Staff comments: "Should I update the About page too?"
    ↓
Client comments: "Yes, please! Good thinking."
    ↓
Client reacts: 👍
    ↓
Staff completes task
    ↓
Client comments: "Perfect! This is exactly what I wanted."
    ↓
Staff reacts: ❤️
```

**Example: Post with Reactions**
```
Staff shares: "Just completed my first month! 🎉"
    ↓
15 people react: 🔥 ❤️ 🎉 👏
    ↓
Management comments: "Congrats! Amazing first month!"
    ↓
Client comments: "So happy to have you on the team!"
    ↓
Staff feels VALUED → Builds company culture
```

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- ✅ **Consistency:** Same behavior everywhere
- ✅ **Simplicity:** One API, one component
- ✅ **Flexibility:** Can comment/react on ANYTHING
- ✅ **Engagement:** Social layer on everything
- ✅ **Less Code:** Don't repeat comment logic 10 times
