## 🔍 **PHASE 2: MANUAL REVIEW NEEDED - 1 FILE**

### **⚠️ `/app/api/documents/route.ts` - NEEDS MANUAL FIX**

**Issue:** This is a generic documents API used by staff, but it references old schema:
- Uses old `source` field ('STAFF', 'CLIENT', 'ADMIN') which no longer exists
- Uses old `sharedWithAll` and `sharedWith` fields
- Should be rewritten to use new `staff_documents` table

**What It Does:**
- GET: Fetches all documents for current staff user (own + client uploads)
- POST: Uploads new document (staff-side)

**Fix Required:**
1. Decide: Keep as generic API or split into `/api/staff/documents/`?
2. Update to use `staff_documents` table
3. Remove references to old `source`, `sharedWithAll`, `sharedWith` fields
4. Update sharing logic for new schema

**Priority:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** (staff documents feature)
