**Catchphrase**: _"If it doesn't glow, it doesn't go! ✨"_

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (10 Minutes) - NO NEW API KEY NEEDED!

### Prerequisites

You already have:
✅ n8n instance running (https://stepten.app.n8n.cloud/)  
✅ Claude API key in `.env` (lines 22-23)  
✅ Claude Sonnet 4 configured  

You need:
⏳ Slack Bot Token (for Slack integration)  
⏳ Supabase credentials (for logging)  
⏳ n8n API key (to create workflows)  

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Add Environment Variables to n8n (2 min)

Your Claude API is in `.env`:
```bash
CLAUDE_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-eHe3ODf6bYcKvs-RjM..."
CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
```

**In n8n:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add these variables:
   - `CLAUDE_API_KEY`: Your key from `.env` line 22
   - `CLAUDE_MODEL`: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (from line 23)
   - `N8N_API_KEY`: Your n8n API key

**Or set in n8n's environment** (if self-hosted):
```bash
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."
export CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
```

---

### Step 2: Import Nova's Workflow into n8n (3 min)

1. **Open n8n**: https://stepten.app.n8n.cloud/
2. Click **Workflows** → **Import from File**
3. Select: **`NOVA-AI-AGENT-CLAUDE-WORKFLOW.json`** ⭐
4. Click **Import**

You should see: **"✨ NOVA - AI Workflow Creator (Claude)"**

---

### Step 3: Configure Credentials (3 min)

Nova needs 2 credentials (Claude is already in env!):

#### A. Slack API  
1. Click on any Slack node
2. Use existing Slack credential or create new
3. Token needs scopes: `chat:write`, `chat:write.public`
4. Save

#### B. Supabase (PostgreSQL)
1. Click on **"Log to Activity Feed"** node
2. Use existing Supabase credential or create new
3. Save

**Note**: No OpenAI credential needed! Nova uses Claude from your `.env`! 🎉

---

### Step 4: Get Nova's Webhook URL (1 min)

1. Click on **"🎀 Nova Webhook"** node
2. Copy the webhook URL (e.g., `https://stepten.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/nova`)
3. **Save this URL** - you'll use it to talk to Nova!

---

### Step 5: Activate Nova! (30 sec)

1. Toggle the **Active** switch at the top right
2. Nova is now LIVE powered by Claude Sonnet 4! 🎉

## 💬 How to Talk to Nova

### Method 1: Direct Webhook (Testing)

```bash
curl -X POST https://stepten.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/nova \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Hey Nova! Create a workflow that posts to Slack when a new ticket is created",
    "channel": "development"
  }'
```

### Method 2: Via Slack Bot

Create a Slack slash command:

```

### Method 3: From Your App

```typescript
// lib/nova-agent.ts
export async function askNova(message: string, channel?: string) {
  const response = await fetch('https://stepten.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/nova', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ message, channel })
  });
  return response.json();
}

// Usage
const result = await askNova(
  "Create a workflow that monitors support tickets and auto-assigns them",
  "development"

console.log(result.response); // Nova's response
console.log(result.powered_by); // "Claude Sonnet 4"

---

## 🔐 Security

### Environment Variables

Your Claude API key is stored as environment variable in n8n:
- ✅ Encrypted at rest
- ✅ Not exposed in workflow JSON
- ✅ Only accessible to workflow execution
- ✅ Can be rotated easily

### Best Practices:

1. **Never commit `.env` to git** ✅ (already in `.gitignore`)
2. **Use environment variables in n8n** ✅
3. **Rotate API keys periodically** ⏳
4. **Monitor usage in Anthropic Console** ⏳
5. **Set up rate limiting** ⏳

---

## 🚀 Advanced Features

### Using Different Claude Models

Want to switch models? Update env variable:

```bash
# In .env or n8n environment
CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-opus-4-20250514"    # Most capable
CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # Balanced (current)
CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-haiku-4-20250514"   # Fastest, cheapest
```

### Custom System Prompt

Edit the **"Nova's AI Brain"** node to customize Nova:

```json
{
  "system": "You are NOVA 'NEON' SINCLAIR...\n\n[Add your customizations here]"
}
```

### Response Streaming

For real-time responses, enable streaming:

```json
{
  "stream": true
}
```

(Requires additional handling in n8n)

  COUNT(CASE WHEN metadata->>'workflow_created' != 'false' THEN 1 END) as workflows_created
FROM activity_feed

```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Nova not responding

**Check:**
- Claude API key in n8n environment
- Workflow is activated
- Webhook URL is correct
- Check n8n execution logs

**Test Claude API directly:**
```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $CLAUDE_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"}]
  }'
```

### Workflow creation fails

**Check:**
- n8n API key in environment
- n8n API endpoint accessible
- Review Nova's response in execution logs

### Slack not posting

**Check:**
- Slack bot token valid
- Bot in channel
- Bot has `chat:write` scope

---
