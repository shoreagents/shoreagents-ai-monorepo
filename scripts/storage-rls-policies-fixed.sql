-- ============================================================
-- âœ… DONE! RLS POLICIES CREATED
-- ============================================================
-- 
-- KEY CHANGE:
-- Instead of comparing auth.uid() directly to folder names,
-- we JOIN to the user tables and compare app user IDs.
--
-- LOGIC:
-- 1. Get auth.uid() (Supabase auth user ID)
-- 2. Find the app user (staff_users, client_users, management_users)
-- 3. Compare app user.id to folder name
--
-- This works because:
-- - File paths use: staff/{staff_users.id}/...
-- - auth.uid() links via: staff_users.authUserId
