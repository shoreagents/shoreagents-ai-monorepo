## ⚠️ PENDING ACTIONS

### **CRITICAL: Database Migration**

The Prisma schema has been updated but NOT yet pushed to the database due to a Prisma dependency issue:

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '@prisma/config'
```

**TO RESOLVE:**

**Option 1: Fix Prisma Dependencies**
```bash
cd "gamified-dashboard (1)"
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

**Option 2: Manual SQL Migration**
Run this SQL directly in your PostgreSQL database:

```sql
-- Update ticket_responses table
ALTER TABLE ticket_responses 
  ALTER COLUMN "staffUserId" DROP NOT NULL,
  ADD COLUMN "managementUserId" TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN "createdByType" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'STAFF',
  ADD COLUMN "attachments" TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
  DROP COLUMN "role";

-- Add foreign key for managementUserId
ALTER TABLE ticket_responses
  ADD CONSTRAINT ticket_responses_managementUserId_fkey 
  FOREIGN KEY ("managementUserId") 
  REFERENCES management_users(id) 
  ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Update tickets table
ALTER TABLE tickets
  ADD COLUMN "createdByType" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'STAFF',
  ADD COLUMN "managementUserId" TEXT;

-- After migration, regenerate Prisma client
-- npx prisma generate
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT NOTES

### **Supabase Bucket Setup:**

Ensure these folders exist in Supabase Storage:

1. **staff** bucket:
   - Create folder: `staff_ticket/`
   
2. **management** bucket:
   - Create folder: `management_ticket/`

### **Environment Variables:**

Already configured:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DIRECT_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

---

## 🎯 KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS

1. **Drag-and-Drop Library:** @dnd-kit/core
   - Modern, accessible, performant
   - Better than react-beautiful-dnd (no longer maintained)

2. **Profile Pictures:** 
   - Staff: `staffUser.avatar`
   - Management: `managementUser.avatar`

3. **Response Tracking:**
   - `createdByType` field: "STAFF" | "MANAGEMENT"
   - Both `staffUserId` and `managementUserId` optional
   - Only one is populated per response

4. **Video Call Naming:**
   - Format: `ticket-call-{ticketId}`
   - Easy to identify and track

5. **Default View:**
   - Kanban board (more visual, better for BPO workflows)
   - Toggle available for list view

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **Prisma Dependency Error:**
   - Cannot run `prisma db push` or `prisma generate`
   - Workaround: Run manual SQL migration (see above)

2. **Missing Test Data:**
   - No tickets in database yet
   - Create test tickets after migration to verify functionality

---

## 📊 PRODUCTION READINESS

**Status:** 90% Complete

**Blockers:**
- Database migration (Prisma dependency issue)

**Time to Production:**
- 10-15 minutes (fix Prisma + run migration)
- 30 minutes testing

---

## 🎉 SUMMARY

The ticket system Kanban board is **architecturally complete** and **code-ready**. All components, API routes, and pages are implemented and linter-clean.

**Main blocker:** Prisma dependency issue preventing database schema update.

**Next steps:**
1. Fix Prisma dependencies (`rm -rf node_modules && npm install`)
2. Run migration (`npx prisma db push`)
3. Test complete flow (staff + management)
4. Push to GitHub
5. Deploy to production
