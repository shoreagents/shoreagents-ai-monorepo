## What To Check in Supabase

After admin completes onboarding, verify these tables:

### 1. staff_users
```sql
SELECT name, "companyId" FROM staff_users WHERE id = 'your-staff-user-id';
```
‚úÖ Should show full legal name + company ID

### 2. staff_profiles
```sql
SELECT * FROM staff_profiles WHERE "staffUserId" = 'your-staff-user-id';
```
‚úÖ Should have demographics (gender, civilStatus, dateOfBirth) + employment data

### 3. staff_personal_records (THE KEY TABLE!)
```sql
SELECT * FROM staff_personal_records WHERE "staffUserId" = 'your-staff-user-id';
```
‚úÖ Should have:
- SSS, TIN, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG numbers
- Emergency contact (name, number, relationship)
- All document URLs (validId, birthCert, nbiClearance, etc.)

**If this row is MISSING:**
‚Üí Check server logs for `‚ùå PERSONAL RECORD CREATION FAILED`
‚Üí The error will tell us why

### 4. work_schedules
```sql
SELECT * FROM work_schedules WHERE "profileId" = 'profile-id-from-step-2';
```
‚úÖ Should have 7 rows (one per day), 5 workdays with shift times

## Console Logs You'll See

### Browser Console (Admin):
```
üîç ADMIN VERIFY: { section: "personalInfo", action: "APPROVED", ... }

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem 1: No console logs in browser
- **Solution:** Make sure F12 DevTools is open BEFORE clicking buttons

### Problem 2: No server logs
- **Solution:** Server might have crashed. Check terminal for errors. Restart if needed.

### Problem 3: Personal records not created
- **Check server logs for:**
  ```
  ‚ùå PERSONAL RECORD CREATION FAILED: [error details]
  ```
- Common errors:
  - **Foreign key constraint:** staffUserId doesn't exist
  - **Unique constraint:** Record already exists (delete old one)
  - **Column does not exist:** Schema mismatch (run `npx prisma generate`)

### Problem 4: Status page shows 404
- **Solution:** The file is at `app/onboarding/status/page.tsx`
- Navigate manually to: `http://localhost:3000/onboarding/status`
- If still 404, restart server
