## üéØ Recommended Approach

### Option A: Complete Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
**Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Phases:** 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 7 (partial - just resume/medical)

**Result:** End-to-end flow works:
- Admin can hire from interview
- Candidate gets signup link
- Candidate signs contract
- Candidate completes enhanced onboarding
- Admin verifies and creates profile

### Option B: Full Implementation
**Time:** 6-8 hours  
**All phases completed**

**Result:** Complete system with all features

### Option C: Phased Rollout (RECOMMENDED)
**Week 1:** Phases 2.5, 3, 4, 5 (hiring + contracts)  
**Week 2:** Phase 7 (enhanced onboarding)  
**Week 3:** Phases 6, 8, 9, 10 (polish)  
**Week 4:** Phases 11, 12, 13 (final features)

## üöÄ Quick Start for Next Session

### To Continue Implementation:

1. **Start with Phase 2.5 (Admin UI)**
   ```bash
   # Open: app/admin/recruitment/page.tsx
   # Add: Hire button to Interview Requests tab
   # Add: HireCandidateModal component
   ```

2. **Then Phase 3 (Signup Auto-fill)**
   ```bash
   # Update: app/login/staff/signup/page.tsx
   # Update: app/api/auth/signup/staff/route.ts
   ```

3. **Then Phase 4 (Contract Signing)**
   ```bash
   # Create: app/contract/page.tsx
   # Create: app/api/contract/sign/route.ts
   ```

### Database is Ready
- No additional schema changes needed until Phase 7
- All relations are live
- Hire API is functional

### Testing Current State
```bash
# Test hire API directly:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/recruitment/interviews/hire \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "interviewRequestId": "uuid-here",
    "position": "Customer Service Rep",
    "companyId": "company-uuid",
    "candidateEmail": "candidate@example.com",
    "bpocCandidateId": "bpoc-uuid"
  }'
```

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions Made
- Contract has checkboxes per section (not page-by-page initials)
- Medical cert can be marked "in progress" (non-blocking)
- Bank details stored as JSON for flexibility
- Welcome form is post-onboarding (not blocking)

### Technical Stack Confirmed
- Prisma for database ORM
- Supabase for file storage
- NextAuth for authentication
- Next.js App Router for routing
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui for styling

### Files Already Created
1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - ‚úÖ Updated
2. `app/api/admin/recruitment/interviews/hire/route.ts` - ‚úÖ Created
3. `ENHANCED-ONBOARDING-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` - ‚úÖ Created
4. `ENHANCED-ONBOARDING-NEXT-STEPS.md` - ‚úÖ This file

## üí° Key Points for Next Developer

1. **Database is live** - All tables exist, relations work
2. **Hire API works** - Returns signup link with jobAcceptanceId
3. **No breaking changes** - Existing onboarding still functional
4. **Incremental approach** - Can deploy phases independently
5. **Well documented** - Plan file has complete implementation details
