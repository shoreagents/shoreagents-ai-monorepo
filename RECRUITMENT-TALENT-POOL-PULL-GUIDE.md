#### **Option A: Cherry-pick just the Recruitment files**
```bash
# Pull frontend pages
git checkout origin/main -- app/client/recruitment/page.tsx
git checkout origin/main -- app/client/talent-pool/page.tsx
git checkout origin/main -- app/client/talent-pool/[id]/page.tsx

# Pull API routes
git checkout origin/main -- app/api/client/candidates
git checkout origin/main -- app/api/client/job-requests
git checkout origin/main -- app/api/client/interviews
```

#### **Option B: Merge just the recruitment commit**
```bash
# Find the recruitment commit SHA from main
git log origin/main --oneline --grep="recruitment" -n 1

# Cherry-pick that specific commit
git cherry-pick <COMMIT_SHA>
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify Files Locally**

# Check that files exist
ls -la app/client/recruitment/
ls -la app/client/talent-pool/

```

### **3. Dependencies**
All UI components already exist in your project:
